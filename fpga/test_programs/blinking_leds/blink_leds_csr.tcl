# Blink leds
#
# This script loads a basic program in memory that blinks LEDs (using a register as a counter).
# To use it, make sure you have the "JTAG to AXI MASTER" in the SoC design;
# program the device in vivado; and source this file. (make sure addresses are ok too). You can then release
# reset on the core.
#
# Fun fact : that this was the very first program entirely written in ASM and then compiled !
