# FPGA EDITION

Oh boy, making a whole core sure was a thing ! But now, the real part is about to start !

Making a RISC-V core is a project many students do, but doing it by implementing the whole RV32I ISA and then actually start using it on FPGA is going beyond that !

Regardless of the fact that you made your own core or that you followed the HOLY CORE (single cycle edition) course, porting your core on FPGA is another story and will really deepen our understanding of the design by tackling the "_memory problem_".

Course Summary :

- Create an AXI Interface
- Create a cache that uses the AXI interface
- Integrate 2 cache in the CPU (data and instructions)
- Test the whole design
- Use the design on FPGA using external BRAM

We have a lot of work to do so let's get started !

## Prerequesites

Before starting, understand this course is not for complete beginners (even though I give as musch details as possible).

You will need to make sure you understood all the concepts given in the single cycle editions of the HOLY CORE course.

### Software

Regarding the software we'll use :

- Testbench : just like the single cycle
  - [cocotb](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/) for assertions (Python)
  - [Verilator](https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/) for simulation (handled by cocotb, no need to learn it)
  - [cocotb AXI extension](https://github.com/alexforencich/cocotbext-axi) to simulate our AXI interfaces in cocotb (here is a [blog post](https://0bab1.github.io/BRH/posts/TIPS_FOR_COCOTB/) for tips on the subject)
  - GTKWave for waves debugging (simple wave viewer to open `dump.vcd`, you can use whatever you like for this purpose)
- Synthesis and Implementation : Vivado (2023.2 on my side)

I really encourage you to read the [blog post](https://0bab1.github.io/BRH/posts/TIPS_FOR_COCOTB/) tips and the **setup manual** from the single edition of you stuggle with the sofware tech stack. Take a moment to setup everything right.

### Hardware

Towards the end of this \*fpga editionù, I'll use a ZYBO Z7-20 embedding a Zynq. I won't use the Zynq's processing system and anything works just fine as long as it's programable logic **so your average FPGA should do the trick**.

![Zybo board](../user_docs/docs/images/zybo.jpg)

Just note that even if I give a lot of details, the actual vivado TCL scripts and constraints file are for my board. It sould not be musch of a problem adapting these to your own needs though.

Here is a list of recommended boards for the porject (all from Xilinx):

| Board / Model | Approx Price | Notes | Link |
|---------------|--------------|-------|------|
| Zybo Z7-10 or 20 | $300–400 | Zynq SoC board (FPGA + ARM); versatile but more expensive | [Digilent Zybo Z7-20](https://digilent.com/shop/zybo-z7-zynq-7000-arm-fpga-soc-development-board/) |
| Arty S7-25 | $120 | Might be hard to fit everything; you’ll need to cut down on interconnects and ILAs | [Digilent Arty S7-25](https://digilent.com/shop/arty-s7-spartan-7-fpga-development-board/) |
| Arty S7-50 | $200 | Perfect board, most recommended! | [Digilent Arty S7-50](https://digilent.com/shop/arty-s7-spartan-7-fpga-development-board/) |
| Basys 3 | $165 | Great board to start with, but no DRAM (only BRAM for program + data) | [Digilent Basys 3](https://digilent.com/shop/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/) |

In general, I would recommend at least 35k lut and 50k+ for confort. The core itself does tkae more than 8K LUT but interconnects, ILAs if yo need to debug and Xilinx IP can take a lot of space very quickly...

### More prerequesites

You also need to get up to speed on [AXI](https://youtu.be/1zw1HBsjDH8?feature=shared) if you did not already.

> Note : some file names were changed and some new files were added for this _fpga edition_. I do **not** go over the adapation of `Makefile`s and imports for simulation in this course.
> If you strugge on this technical matter, refer to the single cycle edition guide, the setup file or the resources. Happy learning !

## 0 : Before we start

Before we start, please refer to the **setup manual** at the root of the tutorials repo to setup the environement correctly.

Please also note that this is a follow-up to the _cingle cycle_ edition of the holy core course. If you did not complete this first edition,
please consider completing it before the _fpga edition_.

As stated in the **setup manual**, we'll use some advanced cocotb features like extensions for testing a custom AXI interface. You can refer to [this blog post](https://0bab1.github.io/BRH/posts/TIPS_FOR_COCOTB/) to learn more.

## 1 : What do we need to use the core on FPGA

Using the core on FPGA is not trivial. I personally though it was _but it's not_ :/ . **It is an entire problem on its own** !

Let's think about what our CPU needs to do for it to be "usable" on FPGA :

- We need to make a synthesizable design
- We need a way to do I/Os with
  - Memory
  - General purpose peripherals (LED, GPIO, UART, ...)

The first main problem we'll tackle in this course is the one of memory to have a working FPGA solution
and then hack our way around to play with GPIO towards the end.

You see, until now we mainly focused on the underlying logic of our core by trying to really understand what each instruction is supposed to do, thus
not paying any attetion to memory (Until now we implement memory as a simple array of words, **accessible in only 1 clock cycle**).

We conviniently forgot that memory is one of the largest problem in computer design (if not the actual largest) and is often the main bottleneck to improving computer nowdays.

Why is that ? Well I can only encourage you to read about it on the internet or in the _Digital Design and Computer Architecture: RISC-V Edition,
(section 8 MEMORY SYSTEMS)_ book from sarrah & David Harris (I'll let you find a pdf ;) ).

In a nutshell, memory is slow. Like very slow. Between the time we request a memory operation on a piece of data (using `lw`, `sw`, ...) and the time the operation is successful, it can take 10, 100 or even more clock cycles ! (given our core is fast enough...)

We need some sort of actual substantial memory to call our core a core, and we might as well make it external ! This will allow us to :

- Use way more data and instructions.
- Initiate memory with whatever program we want on boot.
- Use whatever memory we want outside the core to store data & instructions.
- Learn a lot of things.

We can use whatever memory we want because the time it takes for data to come back (memory speed) is not really relevant.

Why ?

This is because all we'll do is simply **wait for it to arrive** by **stalling** the cpu when we are retrieving or writing data from said external memory ! (Thus making memory operation especially costly in terms of delay !).

To replace our old `memory.sv` logic and interface between the core and external memory, we'll use a **cache** (`$`) system :

![very abstract stall](../user_docs/docs/images/very%20abstract%20stall.png)

> If you don't know what a cache is, refer to the resources to learn more and get yourself up to speed.

Before jumping into any form of design to make the stalling happen, we need to think about what does the cache do and how it actually holds data behind the scenes.

## 2 : Requierements for an "_extremely simple_" cache system

### Requirements

The cache is a way to keep some data in **tighly coupled memory** that we can access in 1 clock cycle, just like before in the _single cycle edition_'s `memory.sv`.

But we can't make this piece of memory very large.
Which is why we need to still be able to request data from external memory (aka _main memory_) when the requested data is not in the cache,
in which case the cache shall **stall** the core and start moving data around.

> Vocabulary : If we request memory operations on data that is not availible in the cache, it is called a **cache miss**, as opposed to a **cache hit**.

So, here is a recap of the requierments of our cache system :

- Have a small set of data (we'll use 128 32bits words).
- Shall be able to request external data if it does not have it.
- Shal be able to **STALL** the cpu when he is doing memory transactions with the main memory.

There are **many ways** to design a cache. Because this course is for learning purpose, we'll go for a very simple one, here is how it will work :

- The cache has 128 words slots called **cache lines** (i will also refer to it as **sets**). This forms a **cache table**, a whole memory block made 128 words (32bits) we can operate instantly without a stall.
- The cache table has a **valid** flag
  - This is because the **cache is invalid on startup**.
- The cache table has a **dirty** flag
  - If we write to the cache table, the data is nom **dirty**, meaning we'll have to write it back to main memory.
- The cache has a **tag** (also called **block**), which indicates what block of memory is actually stored in cache. More on that in the later sub-section.

> The way I descibed this cache makes it a **one way, direct mapped** cache with a **write-back** policy. I encourage you to do some reasearch on different cache policies to deepen your understandin of these terms.

### Concept of tag

When I say **tag**, I refer to the **memory region** (or **memory block**) contained in the cache.

An address is composed of 32bits so when the cache gets an address from the CPU, we decompose the address like so :

| tag / block = address[31:9]                                                 | set = address[8:2]                                         | offset = address[1:0]    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| The main memory blocks from which the current 128 words in cache comes from | 128 words in cache, (cache lines / sets) 7bites addresable | byte off set in the word |

So when the cpu asks to read the data in a certain address, in order to know whether wa have the said data in the cache, we just check the the **incoming** request tag is the same as the one **currently loaded** into the cache (if yes, it's a **hit** !).

Here is the logic to determine the stall signal using the **CPU request** alongside the **cache table** signals.
Note that there is a **register** at the end to ensure that the stall assertion is asynchronous but the de-assertion is synchronous to ensure all AXI transactions (we'll go over that in the next section) are finished before starting fetching new instructions.

![cache without AXI](../user_docs/docs/images/cache%20without%20AXI.png)

### Requesting data from main memory using AXI

So, how do we get our cache do get data from main memory ? Well for this kind of purpose, we need a standard interface to make sure we have support for a broad range of memory solution and controllers.

**AXI** sounds like the perfect solution for that. Even though it is not trivial, it is doable if we put our minds to it.

**AXI** is a standard interface that is covered by many documentation out there so I won't describe it extensively here. AXI is not extremely complex on paper and I **recommend** [this series of video](https://youtu.be/1zw1HBsjDH8?feature=shared) to really get up to speed on how it works (and check out the resources for more learning material).

**AXI** serves as a good on-chip communication interface. It is not meant for communications that goes beyond the chip
but this type of communication can still be done by using AXI to drive a controler that will in turn ensure
comunication with the outside world.

> I encourage you get yourself up to speed on AXI or at least get a refresher before actually implementing it in the later sections.

In this course, we'll use a minimal AXI implementation by using system verilog's `interface` syntax.

By "_minimal_" I mean we'll discard all of the `lock, qos, cache, ....` signals from AXI that are pretty much useless in small design.
They are also optional meaning it's bloat anyway.

We'll drive this axi interface by using a Finite State Machine that can modify the cache using a pointer and that produces a `cache_state` signal which we'll be able to use to know what the cache's AXI interface is currently doing :

![full holy cache with AXI](../user_docs/docs/images/full%20cache.png)

We'll go over this design in more details later (Note this scheme is a simplification).

### Cache system integration to the core

The cache system now has a set of requirements on how it shall work and on how it shall comunicate with the external memory.
**But** how do we actually use it in our core ?

Well, just like the single cycle edition, we'll have :

- An **instructions** cache (Also called `i_cache` or `i$`)
- A **data** cache (A lso called `d_cache` or `d$`)

They both operate separatly and hold their own cache table. Here is what such an integration look like :

![holy core only cache](../user_docs/docs/images/HOLYCORE%20no%20arbitrer.png)

On this scheme I also added the stalling logic that simply makes sures the next PC is set to the current PC whenever the core stalls.

We also group all the **data memory** modules (_reader_, _BE_Decoder_, _d$_) in a same sub-module called `load/store unit` to make it more readable.

This integration raises a problem : we have 2 master axi interfaces going out of the core : one for the `i$`; and the other for the `d$`.

To address this problem, we can add a simple `external_request_arbitrer` module that will "merge" or "**MUX**" both M_AXI into one.

The `external_request_arbitrer` will simply work by probing the different cache state to route on or another cache M_AXI interface to the main core's M_AXI.

![holy core arbitrer](../user_docs/docs/images/arbitrer.png)

And here is the integration with the new external request arbitrer :

![full holy core](../user_docs/docs/images/HOLY_CORE_FPGA.png)

And that was the full core ! Now that we know the _why_, let's do the _how_ shall we ?

## 3 : Actual cache design

Without further ado, with all these requirements in mind for our cache, let's start laying down the HDL design.

### Declaring an axi interface in system verilog

Before doing anything, we'll declare an axi interface in system verilog.
An **interface** is just a way to decalre `input/output` port in a separate structure to make the HDL shorter and avoid huge interface block when
describing a module's logic. We can also use **interfaces** declare different configurations (e.g. slave or master).

Declaring a large interface can be tedious at first but the good thing is you only need to do it once. Here is the interface declaration I'll use for this course :

```verilog
// axi_if.sv

interface axi_if #(
    parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 32,
    parameter DATA_WIDTH = 32,
    parameter ID_WIDTH   = 4
);

    // Global AXI Signals
    logic aclk;
    logic aresetn;

    // Write Address Channel
    logic [ID_WIDTH-1:0] awid;
    logic [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] awaddr;
    logic [7:0] awlen;         // Burst length
    logic [2:0] awsize;        // Burst size
    logic [1:0] awburst;       // Burst type
    logic [3:0] awqos;         // Quality of Service
    logic [1:0] awlock;        // Lock type
    logic awvalid;
    logic awready;

    // Write Data Channel
    logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] wdata;
    logic [(DATA_WIDTH/8)-1:0] wstrb;  // Write strobe
    logic wlast;                       // Last write in burst
    logic wvalid;
    logic wready;

    // Write Response Channel
    logic [ID_WIDTH-1:0] bid;
    logic [1:0] bresp;  // Write response
    logic bvalid;
    logic bready;

    // Read Address Channel
    logic [ID_WIDTH-1:0] arid;
    logic [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] araddr;
    logic [7:0] arlen;         // Burst length
    logic [2:0] arsize;        // Burst size
    logic [1:0] arburst;       // Burst type
    logic [3:0] arqos;         // Quality of Service
    logic [1:0] arlock;        // Lock type
    logic arvalid;
    logic arready;

    // Read Data Channel
    logic [ID_WIDTH-1:0] rid;
    logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] rdata;
    logic [1:0] rresp;  // Read response
    logic rlast;        // Last read in burst
    logic rvalid;
    logic rready;

    // Define modport for master
    modport master (
        input  aclk,
        input  aresetn,

        // Write Address Channel
        output awid,
        output awaddr,
        output awlen,
        output awsize,
        output awburst,
        output awqos,
        output awlock,
        output awvalid,
        input  awready,

        // Write Data Channel
        output wdata,
        output wstrb,
        output wlast,
        output wvalid,
        input  wready,

        // Write Response Channel
        input  bid,
        input  bresp,
        input  bvalid,
        output bready,

        // Read Address Channel
        output arid,
        output araddr,
        output arlen,
        output arsize,
        output arburst,
        output arqos,
        output arlock,
        output arvalid,
        input  arready,

        // Read Data Channel
        input  rid,
        input  rdata,
        input  rresp,
        input  rlast,
        input  rvalid,
        output rready
    );

    // Define modport for slave
    modport slave (
        input  aclk,
        input  aresetn,

        // Write Address Channel
        input  awid,
        input  awaddr,
        input  awlen,
        input  awsize,
        input  awburst,
        input  awqos,
        input  awlock,
        input  awvalid,
        output awready,

        // Write Data Channel
        input  wdata,
        input  wstrb,
        input  wlast,
        input  wvalid,
        output wready,

        // Write Response Channel
        output bid,
        output bresp,
        output bvalid,
        input  bready,

        // Read Address Channel
        input  arid,
        input  araddr,
        input  arlen,
        input  arsize,
        input  arburst,
        input  arqos,
        input  arlock,
        input  arvalid,
        output arready,

        // Read Data Channel
        output rid,
        output rdata,
        output rresp,
        output rlast,
        output rvalid,
        input  rready
    );

endinterface
```

To use the interface, we simply have to add the `axi_if.sv` file as a source for whatever tool we are using (_synth, tb, ..._)
and declare use it normally in other file without an import statement.

As for me in the _HOLY CORE_ code base, I added it to the `packages/` folder.

We will go over actual interface usage in a module during the later sections.
In the meantime, **you can check out this [article](https://www.chipverify.com/systemverilog/systemverilog-interface) which summarizes the subject pretty well**.

> Note : "_Advanced_" systemVerilog concepts like these are not supported by all EDA tools (E.g. Verilator, cocotb, ...). We'll use wrappers to tackle this problem. More on that later.

### Cache's HDL : AXI Finite State Machine and CPU interface

So as you may have understood by now, the cache has to be the intermediate between the slow main memory and the cpu,
each of them having their own way of talking to the cache.

- Main memory uses AXI (as a slave)
- CPU uses regular signals like before (`write_data`,`write_enable`, ...)

And when the cache is talking to memory, he simply signals the CPU to wait while he's in buisness by asserting `stall`.
Here is a reminder of the cache's structure :

![holy cache without AXI](../user_docs/docs/images/full%20cache.png)

To make the whole AXI thing work out, we'll build the cache around a Finite State Machine (FSM).
Here are the different states we'll use to describe _what_ the cache is currently doing with main memory :

- **IDLE**: IDLE is the state where the cache is not doing anything with the AXI interface. It is ready to get cpu's data request and `stall` is not asserted as long as the incomming request are hits
- **SENDING_WRITE_REQ**: The cache had a miss and the cache was dirty. The cache is currently sending a write request to main memory.
- **SENDING_WRITE_DATA**: The cache is sending data burst to main memory.
- **WAITING_WRITE_RES**: The cache is waiting for write confirmation from memory.
- **SENDING_READ_REQ**: The cache had a miss. We now send a read request to retrieve data from main memory back to cache.
- **RECEIVING_READ_DATA**: We cache the data incomming from main memory.

Here is how we can declare them in the `packages/holy_core_pkg.sv` file.

```verilog
// holy_core_pkg.sv

package holy_core_pkg;

  typedef enum logic [2:0] {
      IDLE,
      SENDING_WRITE_REQ,
      SENDING_WRITE_DATA,
      WAITING_WRITE_RES,
      SENDING_READ_REQ,
      RECEIVING_READ_DATA
  } cache_state_t;

  // ...

endpackage
```

### A word on clocking

You might have already guessed it : because our cache system serves as an interface between two systems running at different speed scales
(_CPU & Memory_), it runs on two clocks :

- `aclk` or "axi clock".
- `clk` or... well... `clock` but keep in mind it's the clock incomming from the cpu.

We'll actually use only 1 clock for timing reasons due to Clock Domain Crossing hazards (CDC), which is an entire problem on its own.

But still, let's make the effort to think about what a multi-clock design might have done :

- The **AXI state machine** will be driven by `aclk`.
- The **axi signals** will be derived from **current state** and dirven by **comb logic**.
- The **data caching**, **data related signals** and **writes to cached lines** will be driven by `clk` as writes/reads depend on the CPU.

> If you want to try handling multple clock domains, this implies that "`aclk <= clk`" because if AXI clock is faster,
> then the data will not be written fast enough and the AXI RDATA bus will change before we can cache it.

### Actual HDL for the cache

With that in mind, we can start declaring the core of our cache :

- The CPU's interface with all the signals to take request from the CPU.
- The AXI interface (_that we declared in a separate file_).
- The **cache table**, containing the cache lines and the assocatiated signals (Valid, dirty)

You can refer to the previous cache schemes for guidance.

```verilog
// holy_cache.sv

import holy_core_pkg::*;

module holy_cache #(
    parameter CACHE_SIZE = 128 // FIXED !
)(
    // CPU LOGIC CLOCK & RESET
    input logic clk,
    input logic rst_n,
    input logic aclk, // Axi clock, will be the same as clk in the end..

    // CPU Interface
    input logic [31:0] address,
    input logic [31:0] write_data,
    input logic read_enable,
    input logic write_enable,
    input logic [3:0]byte_enable,
    output logic [31:0] read_data,
    output logic cache_stall,

    // AXI Interface for external requests
    axi_if.master axi
);

    // Here is how a cache line is organized:
    // | DIRTY | VALID | BLOCK TAG | INDEX/SET | OFFSET | DATA |
    // | FLAGS         | ADDRESS INFOS                  | DATA |

    // CACHE TABLE DECLARATION (hardcoded for now, TODO : fix that)
    logic [CACHE_SIZE-1:0][31:0] cache_data;
    logic [31:9]                    cache_block_tag; // direct mapped cache so only one block, only one tag
    logic                           cache_valid;  // is the current block valid ?
    logic                           next_cache_valid;
    logic                           cache_dirty;
    logic                           next_cache_dirty;

endmodule
```

Regarding the `next_cache_valid` signal, it's simply a way to drive the next value of a signal using comb logic like so :

![dq latch](../user_docs/docs/images/dq.JPG)

> Note that we are using the `CACHE_SIZE` parameter. It's fixed to 128 and it shall stay that way as every bit range will be hardcoded from now on.
> (Because I was a beginner and this was easier for me haha)

We will now continue describing the cache's logic by ensuring async reads and sync writes to the cache table using comb logic and
`clk` driven sequential logic.

To do so we need to make sure that the cache has the data available and is not doing anything AXI-Wise.

So we'll declare some hit logic (based on the current tag and the incomming request's tag : `req_tag`).

We'll also assert the state we're in is `IDLE` by declaring some states (even though we did not set their logic yet).

You can refer to the cache schemes for reference :

![full holy cache for hit and stall reference](../user_docs/docs/images/full%20cache.png)

```verilog
// holy_cache.sv

module holy_cache #(
    parameter CACHE_SIZE = 128 // FIXED !
)(
    // CPU LOGIC CLOCK & RESET
    input logic clk,
    input logic rst_n,
    input logic aclk, // Axi clock, will be the same as clk in the end..

    // CPU Interface
    input logic [31:0] address,
    input logic [31:0] write_data,
    input logic read_enable,
    input logic write_enable,
    input logic [3:0]byte_enable,
    output logic [31:0] read_data,
    output logic cache_stall,

    // AXI Interface for external requests
    axi_if.master axi

As you can see, I also added in the logic that cache incomming AXI data when reading from main memory. `set_ptr` is driven by the AXI FSM logic we'll design afterwards.

Now our cache behaves more or less like the memory we had in the _single cycle edition_ (expect we added some flags **and made the main table a packed array** for fpga implementation reasons). Before moving on to stalling,
let's add the states we talked about earlier :

Do do so we use **COMB LOGIC** to :

- Drive the **output** AXI signals
- Determine the `next_state` and `set_ptr` based on **input** AXI signals

We also use **SEQ LOGIC** driven by `aclk`to :

- Incremet the `set_ptr` and switch `state`.
- That's it (wanted to make a bullet list so I have to add this line)

> Note: Constant AXI signals are hardcoded towards the end of the following example.

Enough talking, here is a scheme of the FSM :

![holy core axi FSM](../user_docs/docs/images/axi%20fsm.png)

Of course, depending on the current state, we'll assert diffferent signals and when data is being transfered, we'll
have to modify the `set_ptr` accordingly.

And here is how we can implement it in SystemVerilog :

```verilog
// holy_cache.sv

// ...

// Signals declaration
logic [6:0] set_ptr;
logic [6:0] next_set_ptr;

// Some signal I made to figure out if we're really writing
// (it was a just test, not mandatory)
logic actual_write_enable;
assign actual_write_enable = write_enable & |byte_enable;

// AXI CLOCK DRIVEN SEQ LOGIC
always_ff @(posedge aclk) begin
    if (~rst_n) begin
        state <= IDLE;
        set_ptr <= 7'd0;
    end else begin
        state <= next_state;
        set_ptr <= next_set_ptr;
    end
end

    next_state = state; // Default
    next_cache_valid = cache_valid;

    // the data being send is always set, "ready to go"
    axi.wdata = cache_data[set_ptr];
    cache_state = state;
    next_set_ptr = set_ptr;

    case (state)
        IDLE: begin

```

This chunk of code can be overwhelming if you did not study AXI a little bit. If so, take a bit of time to get yourself
up to speed (see resources section).

Once you put both this FSM and the previous logic together, we get a cache module ! You can refer to the _HOLY CORE_
code base for the full code.

### Testing the cache module

> To design testbenches, we'll use cocotb with verilator in the backend please refer to the resource at
> the end of this document if you need guidance on this.

To test our cache logic, we'll use [**cocotbext.axi**](https://github.com/alexforencich/cocotbext-axi).
It will give us access to a pre-made AXI slave memory to test our cache AXI behavior in simulation.

As we are using an interface, which verilator does not like to see in a top-module I/O for some
reason, we need to declare a wrapper for our cache.

The wrapper's role is simply to "demux" our axi inteface to a bunch of I/Os ports with the same
`m_axi` prefix. If you want an example, check out [this blog post](https://0bab1.github.io/BRH/posts/TIPS_FOR_COCOTB/).

The blog post I just mentionned will guide you through the project setup and use of cocotbext.axi
with wrappers if you need guidance on the subject.

We can now start working on the python testbench by starting with helper functions and constants declarations :

- Constants for cache states, clock perdiods & cache + memory size
- Helper functions to read & dump the cache table (packed array is not really easy to work with otherwise)
- And a last one to generate ramdom words for memory init

```python
# test_holy_cache.py

# Other usual imports...
from cocotbext.axi import AxiBus, AxiRam

# https://github.com/alexforencich/cocotbext-axi
DEADLOCK_THRESHOLD = 10e3

# CACHE STATES CST
IDLE                = 0b000
SENDING_WRITE_REQ   = 0b001
SENDING_WRITE_DATA  = 0b010
WAITING_WRITE_RES   = 0b011
SENDING_READ_REQ    = 0b100
RECEIVING_READ_DATA = 0b101

# clock perdiods, if different, make sure AXI_PERIOD >= CPU_PERIOD
AXI_PERIOD = 10
CPU_PERIOD = 10

# Cach stuff
SIZE = 4096 # 4kB adressable by 3B/12b
CACHE_SIZE = 128 #7 b addressable, SYNC IT WITH THE ACTUAL TB CACHE SIZE

def generate_random_bytes(length):
    return bytes([random.randint(0, 255) for _ in range(length)])

def read_cache(cache_data, line) :
    """To read cache_data, because the packed array makes it an array of bits"""
    l = 127 - line
    return (int(str(cache_data.value[32*l:(32*l)+31]),2))

def dump_cache(cache_data, line) -> int :
    if line == "*" :
        for line_a in range(128): # for fixed cache size of 128
            l = 127 - line_a
            print(hex(int(str(cache_data.value[32*l:(32*l)+31]),2)))
    else :
        print(hex(int(str(cache_data.value[32*line:(32*line)+31]),2)))

# ...
```

And we also create a coroutine that will reset the cache by generating an incomming reset from the CPU :

```python
# test_holy_cache.py

@cocotb.coroutine
async def reset(dut):
    await RisingEdge(dut.clk)
    dut.rst_n.value = 0
    dut.cpu_write_enable.value = 0
    dut.cpu_address.value = 0
    dut.cpu_write_data.value = 0
    dut.cpu_byte_enable.value = 0
    await RisingEdge(dut.clk)
    await RisingEdge(dut.clk)
    dut.rst_n.value = 1

    print("reset done !")

    # Assert all is 0 after reset
    for cache_line in range(dut.cache_system.CACHE_SIZE.value):
        assert read_cache(dut.cache_system.cache_data, cache_line) == 0
```

Once all the helper function are declared, we can declare the main testing function and intialise our system.
You can refer tothe resources if you want clarifications on how I setup the tests and how I use the AXI ramdomslave
from **cocotb.ext**.

```python
# test_holy_cache.py

@cocotb.test()
async def main_test(dut):

    # ==================================
    # CLOCKS & RAM DECLARATION
    # ==================================

    cocotb.start_soon(Clock(dut.clk, CPU_PERIOD, units="ns").start())
    cocotb.start_soon(Clock(dut.aclk, AXI_PERIOD, units="ns").start())
    axi_ram_slave = AxiRam(
        AxiBus.from_prefix(dut, "axi"),
        dut.aclk,
        dut.rst_n,
        size=SIZE,
        reset_active_level=False
    )
    await RisingEdge(dut.clk)
    await reset(dut)

    # ==================================
    # MEMORY INIT WITH RANDOM VALUES
    # ==================================

    mem_golden_ref = []
    for address in range(0,SIZE,4):
        word = generate_random_bytes(4)
        axi_ram_slave.write(address, word)
        mem_golden_ref.append(word)

    for address in range(0,SIZE,4):
        assert mem_golden_ref[int(address/4)] == axi_ram_slave.read(address, 4)
```

Everything is now set up ! We can start testing the cache behavior by testing different scenarios :

- Verify cache's initial state
- READ if cache misses (when it's invalid on startup)
- READ if cache does not misses
- WRITE if cache does not misss
- WRITE BACK when read after cache is dirty
- WRITE if cache misses

If you did the **single_cycle** edition and you understood the testbench setupd, then the following code is pretty self-explainatory.
Just keep in mind that we (theorically) have no control over the memory, and it just reacts to our axi signals (which is a great thing to test our design !).

```python
# test_holy_cache.py

# previous imports, helper functions & constants

Once the design passes our basic testbench, we can start to implement it in the core.

## 4 : Cache integration (Abritrer)

### External request arbitrer

To integrate our cache design to the core, we have to agree on some design choices :

- We use 2 caches
  - One for data (`D$`)
  - The other instructions (`I$`)
- We'll only have one external axi interface going out from the core

Given there is one AXI interface per cache and only one going out of the core, we need to figure out a way to "merge" both interface into one.

Of course merging, two AXI interface toghteher is simply not possible but what we can do, is have a sort of **MUX** that either connects the instruction's AXI interface to the outside or the data's one.

It would look like this :

![external AXI request arbitrer simplified](../user_docs/docs/images/external%20AXI%20request%20arbitrer%20simplified.png).

One question now remains : **How do we decide what AXI interface gets to get muxes to the outside ?**. To answer, we can first make some assumptions

1. Both outgoing interfaces are **masters**, meaning the outside world (slaves) will never send requests.
2. We can know what master is sending a request to the peripherals based on the corresponding `cache_state`.
3. If a cache is **not** in `IDLE` mode, we grant him access to the outside.
4. If both caches need data, we prioritize the instruction cache.

> Note that the choice of prioritizing the **I$** is arbitrary because caches stall the core when they are requesting data.

We now introduce some control logic for our custom interconnect :

It's a tad long but fairly simple.

To test this logic, we can heavily levrage **cocotbext-axi** to simulate 2 masters (that will act as caches) and an AXI RAM memory slave.

If you needs hints on how to use **cocotbext-axi**, refer to the previous cache test-bench example or check out the resources.

In the following example, we'll test the following scenarios :

1. Only `D$` writes
2. Only `I$` reads
3. Only `D$` reads
4. Both `I$` and D$ reads
5. Both `I$` and D$ writes

## 5 : Cache integration (New core)

### Verilog integration

Recall the schemes for our final design :

![full holy core](../user_docs/docs/images/HOLY_CORE_FPGA.png)

We see that we now have all the missing pieces to make it happen.

Note that the `load_store_unit` is simply a wrapper for all the logic that surronds the data transactions :

- The `BE_decoder`
- The `data_cache`
- The `reader`
- And all internal signals...

Here is an in depth view as a reminder :

![Holy core's load store unit](../user_docs/docs/images/lsu.png)

_Nota :_ `LSU` a common term in computer design but for us **it's just a way to make the schemes simpler**,
**we won't create any additional module**. With that being said, integration should be relatively simple compared to
the previous designs.

> Tip : start from the **single cycle edition** cpu's verilog file as I won't rewrite the entire core here.

We start by adding a `read_enable` signal to the control unit (And then add it to the control unit's test bench according to the single cycle edition method) :

```verilog
// control.sv

module control (
    // ...
    output logic mem_write, // NEW SIGNAL DECLARED HERE
    // ...
);

import holy_core_pkg::*;

/**
* MAIN DECODER
*/

// ...

always_comb begin
    case (op)
        // I-type
        OPCODE_I_TYPE_LOAD : begin
            // ...
            mem_read = 1'b1; // NEW SIGNAL HERE
            // ...
        end

        // Don't forget to set new meme_read to 0 on others OP codes...

        // Rest of the file (...)
```

Our `holy_cache` module needs this `read_enable` to signal our cache a read in order for it to stall
if the data isn't available.

We then move on to the **holy_core** file (_previously called cpu.sv)_ to integrate the caches. Just like in the single cycle edition,
data and instruction are implemented differently (e.g. instruction cache's read is always asserted).

Here is an overview of this integration :

```verilog
// holy_core.sv

`timescale 1ns/1ps

module holy_core (
    // IOs ...
);

// Declare interfaces
axi_if m_axi_data();
axi_if m_axi_instr();

// ..

holy_cache instr_cache (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst_n(rst_n),
    .aclk(m_axi.aclk), // (will by the same as main clk anyway).

    // CPU IF
    .address(pc),
    .write_data(32'd0),
    .read_enable(1'b1),
    .write_enable(1'b0),
    .byte_enable(4'd0),
    .read_data(instruction),
    .cache_stall(i_cache_stall),

    // M_AXI EXERNAL REQ IF
    .axi(m_axi_instr),
    .cache_state(i_cache_state)
);

/**
* CONTROL
*/

// ...
wire mem_read_enable;
// ...

control control_unit(
    // ...
    .mem_read(mem_read_enable),
    // ...
);

// ...

/**
* DATA CACHE
*/

// ...

holy_cache data_cache (
    .clk(clk),
    .rst_n(rst_n),

    .aclk(m_axi.aclk),

    // CPU IF
    .address(alu_result),
    .write_data(mem_write_data),
    .read_enable(mem_read_enable),
    .write_enable(mem_write_enable),
    .byte_enable(mem_byte_enable),
    .read_data(mem_read),
    .cache_stall(d_cache_stall),

    // M_AXI EXERNAL REQ IF
    .axi(m_axi_data),
    .cache_state(d_cache_state)
);

// ...

endmodule
```

### Adapting the _single cycle edition's_ test program & testbench

In the _single cycle edition_, we made a very rigid testbench where each clock cycle was the equivalent of a new instruction.

But now, on top of the actual core's logic, we have a couple of cache modules that will sometime stall the core to require data.

This means some clock cycles won't do anything and we'll have to wait until the stalling is no more to fetch another instruction.

So here is what we need to do :

- Create a **test harness** (Which is just a glorified `axi_translator` wrapper we already designed for cache's and arbitrer's testbenches) to add the simulated AXI RAM slave.
- Init the AXI RAM slave's memory with our test program (requires some hackery and helper functions)
- Add some waiting loops where needed (I used a trial and error method to only add it where needed, not very "pro" but its fast and it works)

So let's to work ! We create the axi_translator wrapper and name it "`holy_test_harness`" to make it look "_pro_" and proceed to write the exact same logic as an `axi_transltor.sv`.

Then we create the helper functions we'll need to init the memory, generate the clocks, and read the cache for assetions (remember : our _single cycle edition's_ testbench makes assertions on memory)

The function in charge of initiating the AXI RAM memory has to perform some formating as our `test_imemory.hex` file has some comments we need to get rid of.

And the function in charge of reading the cache is now necessary as we changed our cache table definition for a packed array,wich reads only raw bits we need to translate.
Thanksfully, we can easily leverage python's `int()` function with base 2 fot that.

```python
# test_holy_core.py

# Other usual imports...
from cocotbext.axi import AxiBus, AxiRam

# WARNING : Passing test on async cloks does not mean CDC timing sync is met !
AXI_PERIOD = 10
CPU_PERIOD = 10

# Other previous helper functions ...

def read_cache(cache_data, line) :
    """To read cache_data, because the packed array makes it an array of bits..."""
    l = 127 - line
    return (int(str(cache_data.value[32*l:(32*l)+31]),2))

@cocotb.coroutine
async def inst_clocks(dut):
    """this instantiates the axi environement & clocks"""
    cocotb.start_soon(Clock(dut.aclk, AXI_PERIOD, units="ns").start())
    cocotb.start_soon(Clock(dut.clk, CPU_PERIOD, units="ns").start())

@cocotb.coroutine
async def init_memory(axi_ram : AxiRam, hexfile, base_addr):
    addr_offset = 0
    with open(hexfile, "r") as file:
        for raw_instruction in file :
            addr = addr_offset + base_addr
            str_instruction = raw_instruction.split("/")[0].strip()
            instruction = int(str_instruction, 16).to_bytes(4,'little')
            axi_ram.write(addr, instruction)
            axi_ram.hexdump(addr,4)
            addr_offset += 4
```

And then we can start adapting the _single cycle edition's_ testbench.

Here is a breakdown of the test setup :

- Start clocks
- Declare the AXI BUS & RAM slave
- Reset the core
- Init the memory with our files
  - As we only have 1 RAM now, we need to map the data and instruction to different addresses/memory regions (**memory mapping**)

```python
# test_holy_core.py

@cocotb.test()
async def cpu_insrt_test(dut):

    await inst_clocks(dut)

    # ==============
    # Testbench MEMORY MAP
    # ==============
    # 0x1FFF
    # Data
    # 0x1000 (stored in gp : x3)
    # ==============
    # 0x0FFF
    # Instructions
    # 0x0000
    #===============

    SIZE = 2**13
    axi_ram_slave = AxiRam(
        AxiBus.from_prefix(dut, "m_axi"),
        dut.aclk,
        dut.aresetn,
        size=SIZE,
        reset_active_level=False
    )

    await cpu_reset(dut)
    await init_memory(axi_ram_slave, "./test_imemory.hex", 0x0000) 
    # more on the new program later...
    await init_memory(axi_ram_slave, "./test_dmemory.hex", 0x1000)
```

As you can see, we use memory mapping to store both instructions and data on the same RAM.

This means data accesses cannot happen on the same 0x00000000 base address anymore and that all data altering instructions has to be adapted.

To do so, we'll store the new data base address (we chose 0x1000) into a register using the following instruction. I chose x3 as it was unsed in the rest of the test program.

```asssembly
lui x3 0x1 # x3  <= 00001000
```

Then we adapt each and every data access and writes like so :

```c
# from...
00802903  //LW  TEST START :    lw x18 0x8(x0)      | x18 <= DEADBEEF
# ...to
0081A903  //LW  TEST START :    lw x18 0x8(x3)      | x18 <= DEADBEEF
```

And we end up with a new test program :

```txt
// test_imemory.hex

000011B7  //DATA ADDR STORE     lui x3 0x1          | x3  <= 00001000

01497AB3  //AND TEST START :    and x21 x18 x20     | x21 <= DEAD8889

FFD3C983  //LBU TEST START :    lbu x19 -3(x7)      | x19 <= 000000BE
FFD39A03  //LH TEST START :     lh x20 -3(x7)       | NO WRITE IN REGISTER ! 
FFA39A03  //                    lh x20 -6(x7)       | x20 <= FFFFDEAD
FFD3DA83  //LHU TEST START :    lhu x21 -3(x7)      | NO WRITE IN REGISTER ! 
FFA3DA83  //                    lhu x21 -6(x7)      | x21 <= 0000DEAD
00000013  //NOP
00000013  //This program was translated in HEX by hand. Please help.
// NOPs (...)
```

Now that we have an adapted program... We can test it !

The testbench is already mostly layed out from the single cycle edition, **but there are a few things to take care of before we can start running it**.
Here is a reminder of our TODO list :

- (DONE) Create a **test harness**.
- (DONE) Init the AXI RAM slave's memory.
- (TODO) Add some waiting loops where needed (and adapt memory assertions using new helper functions).

Regarding the **waiting loop**, here is an example assertion for the very first instruction :

```python
# test_holy_core.py

# ...

    ##################
    # SAVE BASE ADDR IN X3
    # 00000193  //DATA ADDR STORE                         | x3  <= 00001000
    ##################
    print("\n\nSAVING DATA BASE ADDR\n\n")

    # Wait a clock cycle for the instruction to execute
    while(dut.core.stall.value == 1) :
        await RisingEdge(dut.clk)

    await RisingEdge(dut.clk) # lui x3 0x1
    # Check the value of reg x18
    assert binary_to_hex(dut.core.regfile.registers[3].value) == "00001000"

    # ...
```

The core will stall as the instruction cache is non valid on startup, meaning the core will fetch the instructions from the RAM and stall.
On the frontend, we simply wait for the stall signals to go low. The same goes for all memory-wise instructions.

Then, when also did assertions on the memory's state in the _single cycle edition_ to check if the stores were effective.
Because simple array memory is not a thing anymore with our brand new cache (now **packed array**), we'll simply re-work these assertions by using the `read_cache`
helper function we defined earlier :

```python
# test_holy_core.py

# ...

    ##################
    # STORE WORD TEST
    # 0121A623  //SW  TEST START :    sw x18 0xC(x3)      | 0xC <= DEADBEEF
    ##################
    print("\n\nTESTING SW\n\n")
    test_address = int(0xC / 4)

    # Check the inital state
    # assert binary_to_hex(dut.core.data_cache.cache_data[test_address].value) == "F2F2F2F2"
    assert read_cache(dut.core.data_cache.cache_data, test_address) == int("F2F2F2F2",16)

    await RisingEdge(dut.clk) # sw x18 0xC(x3)
    assert read_cache(dut.core.data_cache.cache_data, test_address) == int("DEADBEEF",16)

    # ...
```

Applying these principles to all asssetions in the testbench makes the test runs smoothly.

### Adding a final assertion

We grab this opprtunity to add a new and final test to the holy core testbench : **testing the cache write back**.
In this test, we'll take the time to check if the core does correctly write back the information it holds when needed.

Because the last tests in the original testbench are **STORE** instructions, we can simply load a piece of data not contained
in the current cache content, and with the cache being dirty, this should create _cache miss_ and a _write back_, effectively **updating the actual RAM content**.
(We'll later use this method to update GPIO on real FPGA)

So we add some instructions to our test program :

```txt
20018393  //CACHE WB TEST :     addi x7 x3 0x200| x7  <= 00001200 (just above cache size)
0003AA03  //                    lw x20 0x0(x7)  | x20 <= 00000000 MISS, WRITE BACK, RELOAD
```

And we then proceed to add some assertions. We'll use the `read()` method from **cocotbext-axi** to read actual RAM content after write-back.

```python
# test_holy_core.py

# ...

#################
# CACHE WB TEST
# 20018393  //CACHE WB TEST :     addi x7 x3 0x200| x7  <= 00001200 (just above cache size)
# 0003AA03  //                    lw x20 0x0(x7)  | x20 <= 00000000 MISS, WRITE BACK, RELOAD
##################

# Check test's init state
assert binary_to_hex(dut.core.instruction.value) == "20018393"

await RisingEdge(dut.clk) # addi x7 x3 0x200
assert binary_to_hex(dut.core.regfile.registers[7].value) == "00001200"

assert dut.core.stall.value == 0b1
assert dut.core.data_cache.next_state.value == SENDING_WRITE_REQ

# Wait for the cache to retrieve data
while(dut.core.stall.value == 0b1) :
    await RisingEdge(dut.clk)

await RisingEdge(dut.clk) # lw x20 0x0(x7)
assert binary_to_hex(dut.core.regfile.registers[20].value) == "00000000"
assert axi_ram_slave.read(0x00001004, 4) == 0xFFEE0000.to_bytes(4,'little')
```

## 6 : FPGA integration and debugging

### SoC overview

Now is the time to finally get this whole thing running on FPGA.

We prepared everything right for this moment, the only thing that remains is to know what we want to do. I suggest we try to **BLINK AN LED** !

Before starting here are a few specifics on what I use :

I use a Zybo Z7-20 for the board

![zybo z7-20 board](../user_docs/docs/images/zybo.jpg)

And I also use vivado 2023.2 as an EDA.

It's better if you have the same environment as me (especially for the EDA) but if you don't, no big deal as the principle stays the same.

Here is a schematic of the SoC we'll put together :

![SoC shemes for HOLY CORE](../user_docs/docs/images/SoC_simple.png)

There are a few new things here, let me get you up to speed on these :

#### The ILA debug tool

We'll add some output signals to our core. These signals are the most important we shall be monitoring like

- Current program counter
- Current instruction
- The cache states
- The cache internal state pointers for AXI data transactions
- The CPU reset signal
- ...

ILA allows us to debug the core **LIVE** on FPGA and monitor what is going right -or most likely- wrong.

Get up to speed on this one (_very important_) if you did not already. It is also pretty well documented on internet.

#### JTAG

We'll add a JTAG to AXI MASTER IP. This will allows to have a hand on the system peripherals before releasing the core's `reset_n`.
This way, we can test the peripherals and load data (aka an actual program), in the BRAM.
We then simply realease the core's `reset_n` and it will start fetching the said data we just loaded through JTAG.

We'll use TCL scripts to control this JTAG to AXI MASTER IP.

#### AXI to AXI LITE converter

To actually control the GPIO, we'll have to use some tricks,
like trigger a write-back to actually send updated status to the AXI GPIO IP.

Another thing is we did not implement AXI LITE, which would have been ideal here but
I really did not want to spend more time on implementing AXI stuff
for now so I chose to go for a simple AXI to AXILITE converter.

We'll also have to use a few software tricks to get this thing to works,
more on that later.

### Adding debug signals to the core

Regarding the debug signals, you can use whatever you want. The bare minimu are PC and instrcution in my opinion,
I also added a variety of cache signals as my cache was pretty buggy at first :

```verilog
// holy_core.sv

module holy_core (
    input logic clk,
    input logic rst_n,
    // AXI Interface for external requests
    axi_if.master m_axi,

    // OUTGOING DEBUG SIGNALS
    output logic [31:0] debug_pc,
    output logic [31:0] debug_pc_next,
    output logic [31:0] debug_instruction,
    output logic [2:0] debug_i_cache_state,
    output logic [2:0] debug_d_cache_state,
    output logic [6:0] debug_i_set_ptr,
    output logic [6:0] debug_i_next_set_ptr,
    output logic [6:0] debug_d_set_ptr,
    output logic [6:0] debug_d_next_set_ptr,
    output logic debug_i_cache_stall,
    output logic debug_d_cache_stall
);

import holy_core_pkg::*;

/**
* FPGA Debug_out signals
*/

assign debug_pc = pc;
assign debug_pc_next = pc_next;
assign debug_instruction = instruction;
assign debug_i_cache_state = i_cache_state;
assign debug_d_cache_state = d_cache_state;
assign debug_i_cache_stall = i_cache_stall;
assign debug_d_cache_stall  = d_cache_stall;

// ...
```

You might need to add some of these signals as outputs to submodules, I'll let you do your own experiments on that matter.

### Implementing the SoC in vivado

> There is a vivado TCL automation script in `fpga/zybo_z720`, you can use it even if you don't own the same board to have the
> pre-built SoC without the hassle of using vivado (the less we use it, the better haha). You can then use this example to
> make your own. Below is a description of this process to make it manually.

If you are not familiar with vivado, you can get yourself up to speed using the resources.

So open a new project and add **ALL** the files (including the ones in `package/` except `memory.sv` as we don't use it in this design).

Because vivado does not like systemVerilog as a top module, we'll need to create 2 wrappers :

- One system verilog wrapper that does the same thing as `axi_translator` but routes all signals as outputs (called it `axi_details.sv`)
- One "Regular" verilog wrapper that simply routes all outputs as... outputs, except it's plain verilog.
  (`holy_wrapper.v`)

You can find these files under the `fpga/` folder of the _fpga edition_.

We can now proceed to add these file to our sources in vivado and create a new block design.

We can then add (by a drag and drop) our `holy_wrapper.v` top module in the block design.

After that, simply add all of the other components like so :

![final holy core fpga soc in vivado](../user_docs/docs/images/SoC_final.png)

You can then validate the block design, generate an HDL wrapper an set this wrapper as the new top module for synthesis.

Before launching synthesis and implementation, you should add an adapted constraints file. This file tells to what PIN the I/Os of the block design are mapped (only resets as thes others are automatically handled by vivado).

Here is the example you can find under `fpga_edition/fpga/zybo_z720/constraints.xdc`.

```tcl
# CONSTRAINT FILE FOR TARGET BOARD : ZYBO Z7-20 ONLY

set_property PACKAGE_PIN T16 [get_ports cpu_reset]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports cpu_reset]

set_property PACKAGE_PIN W13 [get_ports axi_reset]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports axi_reset]
```

The clock speed is set to 50MHz in my example.

We can now launch bitstream generation & flash the said bitstream onto the board. We'll be greeted by the ILA dubugger that we can leverage to check on our live debug signals.

![ila debugging](../user_docs/docs/images/ila2.png)

> If you are not familiar with ILA debugging yet, it is a very powerful tool that you should learn. See the resources to learn more.

Now, we put the CORE on reset and the AXI interfaces on active using the buttons we defined in our constraint file like in the following example :

![flashed board reset](../user_docs/docs/images/flashed%20board%20reset.png)

We can now move on to building a program.

### Running a program on the CPU : LED blink

There are exmaple TCL scripts you can use under `fpga_edition/fpga/test_programs/`. Here, I will descibe the process to make your own.

To run a program, we need to get our hands on an hexadecimal version of the said program.

To do so, let's code an assembly version of an LED counter :

```c
# test.s

.section .text
.align 2
.global _start

start:
    # Initialization
    lui x6, 0x2                 # Load GPIO base address
    addi x19, x0, 0x0           # Set offset to 0
    addi x20, x0, 0x80          # Set offset limit to 128 (i.e., cache size)
    addi x18, x0, 0
    j loop

loop:
    # reset offsets
    addi x6, x0, 0
    lui x6, 0x2                 # Load GPIO base address
    addi x19, x0, 0x0           # Set offset to 0

    addi x18, x18, 0x1
    j sub_loop

sub_loop:
    sw x18, 0(x6)
    addi x6, x6, 0x4
    addi x19, x19, 0x1
    bne x19, x20, sub_loop

    lw x23, 0(x0)               # Done! Create a cache miss to write back.

    # Delay loop: Wait for ~50,000,000 clock cycles
    li x21, 50000000      # Load 50,000,000 into x21

delay_loop:
    addi x21, x21, -1           # Decrement x21
    bnez x21, delay_loop        # If x21 != 0, continue looping

    j loop                      # Restart the loop

```

This code is pretty self explainatory except there are a few software trick to make the SoC work out :

- We have to trigger a cache miss after each data update for the cache to create a write-back sequence.
- We fill the **ENTIRE** cache with the data we want to write. Because AXI GPIO only has a `0x0` to `0xF` address range. Addresses above that "wraps around" instead of being ignored,
meaning if we have 0s in the cache (or any other un-related data) in the higher addresses,
they will overwrite the lower ones.
There are others ways to tackle this specific problem but here the simplest way was just to fill the entire cache with the data and call it a day.

Then we can compile this to raw hexadecimal. To get the right syntax, use `make build_test_hex` in the
`Makefile` under `fpga_edition/fpga/test_programs/`.

We can then use this compiles hexadecimal dump and paste in the tcl script. Here is an exmaple :

```tcl
# blink_leds.tcl

reset_hw_axi [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1]
set bram_address 0x00000000
set wt axi_bram_wt
create_hw_axi_txn $wt [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1] -type write -address $bram_address -len 20 -data {
    00002337
    00000993
    08000a13
    00000913
    0040006f
    00000313
    00002337
    00000993
    00190913
    0040006f
    01232023
    00430313
    00198993
    ff499ae3
    00002b83
    02fafab7
    080a8a93
    fffa8a93
    fe0a9ee3
    fc9ff06f
}

run_hw_axi [get_hw_axi_txns $wt]
```

Once this is done, the program is in the BRAM, ready to run.

To run it simply realease the CORE's `reset` signal. And _voilà_ ! blinking LEDs !

![counter program running](../user_docs/docs/images/working%20leds.png)

## 7 : Making the core's cache more usable: introducing CSRs ! (Zicsr)

> The core works ! That's great !

Yes it's great, but we have to move on because the core is **not really usable** as we have to manually make weird manipulations to clear the cache and us MMIO (Memory Mapped Input Output).

To handle this problem, we can use multiple techniques :

- Add a way to bypass the cache (non-cachable range) to a certain memory range
  - e.g. 0x4000_0000 to 0x4000_FFFF would bypass the cache by using AXI-LITE to write directly to the destination.
  - means we have to complexify our interface and development (add AXI-LITE, which we'll have to live debug on top of tb)
  - weird user experience (has to know core specific memory ranges)
  

We'll do so by adding CSRs (**Control Status Registers**) extension support (Zicsr) which allows us to set control registers to allows the user to have direct control on the core behavior (like order a cache flush easily.

> Note : Zicsr defines a whole set of CSRs to handle stuff like interrupts, exceptions and priviledges. for now, we will focus on creating simple custom CSRs that will be used to set non cachable range and flush the cache when needed. In the next *HOLY CORE* course edition (*SoC & Software Edition*), we will use CSRs extensively to support traps, but for now, let's keep it simple to lay dfown the basics and understand how these special registers work.

#### Okay so what really are CSRs ? (Control Status Registers)

Well we can say it's just another register file the user (the guy who will program stuff for our core) can use to interact **DIRECTLY** with the core ! And by "interacting" I mean checking status on what's happenning of send directives on how to behave in certain situations, which sound complicated and abstract but don't worry, this will become very clear in a minute.

You may have seen it comming, but we'll allows the user to control cache behavior via these CSRs.

> Note that because this is proper to the HOLY CORE architecture, these CSRs wil be "custom". This is a good start to learn how to manipulate these.

So we'll start by reading what are CSRs here : [(clickable link)](https://five-embeddev.com/riscv-user-isa-manual/latest-latex/csr.html#csrinsts) and we see that the ISA only defines an instruction type that looks like an I-type :

| csr addr     | rs1 / unsigned imm | f3  | rd   | op      |
| ------------ | ------------------ | --- | ---- | ------- |
| XXXXXXXXXXXX | XXXXX              | XXX | XXXX | 1110011 |

> We'll call this OP type "**SYSTEM**".

You may also see that there are 12 bits to address the CSRs, which means there are 8192 possible CSRs, 

The F3 field will control what specific operation we want to do but the idea is always the same :

1. We write CSR content into `rd`
2. We replace that said content by what is rs1

Now, there are a couple of specificities because there are 6 different CSR instruction. Accounting for unsigned version there are really only 3.

Here is what they do :

| Name   | What they do                                                               | f3  |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| CSRRW  | Exactly what we just described                                             | 001 |
| CSRRS  | Same, but does not replace entirly ! It runs a bitwise OR (csr <= rs \| csr)       | 010 |
| CSRRC  | Same, but does not replace entirly ! It runs a bitwise NAND (csr <= ~rs \& csr) | 011 |
| CSRRI  | Same but rs is replaced with 5bits immediate, zero exented                 | 101 |
| CSRRSI | Same but rs is replaced with 5bits immediate, zero exented                 | 110 |
| CSRRCI | Same but rs is replaced with 5bits immediate, zero exented                 | 111 |

But why these bitwise operations ? Well here are some use cases where it's useful :

- CSRRS for setting flags
- CSRRS / CSRRS for simply reading (set rs / uimm to 0)
- CSRRC to unset flags
- ...

Last thing, the elephant in the room : **yes, CSR are addressable on 12bits**, meaning you can have 4096 CSRs, which is a lot of possibilities, but some address ranges are reserved by the specs (which we will explore in the next edition of this course). Just know that the custum CSRs can only be addressed in the 0x7C0 to 0x7FF in our case. This range choice is in preparation for the next edition.

Alright so not that we have the idea down, time to get to work and implement it !

## 8 : Implementing `Zicsr` : building the CSR Regfile

## 8.1 : A simple custom `Zicsr` example for cache control.

Alright, we will start with our simple `Zicsr` introductory example : adding a `flush_cache` order. The objective is for the user to simply send a cache dump order that will re-write all the cache content back to memory unconditionnally.

The way `flush_cache` will work is by simply setting the lowest bit to 1, the cache will stall and **write back** all its data through AXI. In a nutshell, it will simply force a transition into the SEND_WRITE_REQ state and the rest will flow naturally as the state transition logic is already written and tested.

> To keep this example simple, we'll say that the cache will only write back and do so unconditionally on every cache flush order. It will be the user's responsability to use this wisely.

Then the harware automatically resets the flag to 0 afeter its raised and life goes on:

![flushing timing diagram](../user_docs/docs/images/flush_timing.png)

Here is what the module would look like :

![csr file scheme](../user_docs/docs/images/csr_file.png)

The broad idea is to add a 12bits addressable register file, where we implement ONLY the registers we need. The CSR file then ouput some arbitrary control signals from these CSRs (and in the future, will also be able to recieve inputs to set different CSRs).

So, without further ado, let's create a new `csr_file.sv` file !

### 8.1.a : HDL Code

The HDL is a bit special here : we are **NOT** going to declare a BRAM block (packed array or whatever) of 4096 registers sitting there in the CPU. Oh no ! That would be such a waste of space.

What we'll do instead is declare it 1 by 1 ! You could do some fancy syntax to only generate the CSRs you need but it would be tidious to read, maintain, and really... who cares about them nerdy ways ? let's focus on doing something that **works**.

And before moving on to the HDL, some final details on the behavior (which are not Risc-V standards but it will do the trick for now) of the module :

- It outputs control signals / flags (like `flush_cache_flag`) that will go **into** the cache to tell it when to flush.
- If the address asked is not attributed, then we just read 0x0000_0000 and do not alter any CSR state.
- If the `f3` is not specified (000 or 100) then we write 0x0000_0000 to the addressed CSR
- `flush_cache` should be immedialty set back to 0 once the **flag** is asserted.
  - This is because we set the flag for 1 cycle, the cache will see and will transition STATE to write back "instantly", so we can automatically set back to 0, assuming that the cache will execute the order.

Here is the final logic :

```verilog
// csr_file.sv

module csr_file (
    // IN
    input logic clk,
    input logic rst_n,
    input logic [2:0] f3,
    input logic [31:0] write_data,
    input logic write_enable,
    input logic [11:0] address

    // OUT DATA
    output logic [31:0] read_data,

    // OUT CSR SIGNALS
    output logic flush_cache_flag
);

// Declare all CSRs and they next signals here
logic [31:0] flush_cache, next_flush_cache;

always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    if(~rst_n) begin
        flush_cache <= 32'd0;
    end
    else begin
        flush_cache <= next_flush_cache;
    end
end

// Specific CSRs logics
always_comb begin

    // Flush cache CSR logic
    if(flush_cache_flag) begin
        next_flush_cache = 32'd0; // if we sent the flush flag, reset on the next cycle
    end
    else if (write_enable && (address == 12'h7C0))begin
        next_flush_cache = write_back_to_csr;
    end
    else begin
        next_flush_cache = flush_cache;
    end

    // Other CSRs logic in the future ...
    // ...
end

// Always output the CSR data at the given address (or 0)
always_comb begin
    case (address)
        12'h7C0: read_data = flush_cache;
        // Other CSRs reads in the future ...
        // ...
        default: read_data = '0;
    endcase
end

// Compute next CSR possible values
logic [31:0] or_result;
logic [31:0] nand_result;

always_comb begin
    or_result = write_data | read_data;
    nand_result = read_data & (~write_data);
end

// Select value using F3
logic [31:0] write_back_to_csr;

always_comb begin
    case (f3)
        3'b001, 3'b101 : write_back_to_csr = write_data;

        3'b010, 3'b110 : write_back_to_csr = or_result;

        3'b011, 3'b111 : write_back_to_csr = nand_result;

        default : begin
            write_back_to_csr = 0;
        end
    endcase
end

// output control signals
always_comb begin : control_assignments
    flush_cache_flag = flush_cache[0];
end

endmodule
```

As you can see, the logic behind the CSR is purely comb, which allows for better control on each individual CSR's logic.

We also set the `flush_cache_flag` to only be the LSB of our CSR (flag), the others are useless.

### 8.1.b : Verification

As a testbench, we will define 2 tests:

1. To test R/W behavior in an easily extensible way for the future.
2. To test if the cache control output is driven correctly.

```python
# test_csr_file.py

# For basic R/W randomized testing
RW_REGS = [0x7C0] # we can add more to test in the future..

                    == (init_csr_value & (~wd & 0xFFFFFFFF))
                )

    assert dut.flush_cache_flag.value == 0b0
    assert dut.flush_cache.value == 0x00000000
    dut.write_enable.value = 0
```

Once this is done, we can update our cache to take this order into account.

## 8.2 : Adding manual cache flush support to the `holy_cache`

Oay so now the user can set an order to flush the cache from software using CSRs but how do we even flush the cache ?

Lucky us, we manage our cache using a state machine. This means we can simply add an input and force the FSM's state to `SENDING_WRITE_REQ` which will automaticcaly unroll the whole `write_back` AXI procedure.

> As we don't need to read after in a cache flush, we can also use a `csr flushing` boolean that will go high when a CSR flush is requested. This way, we can check the said boolean register to skip the read sequence if necessary. More details in the FSM schemes below.

Here is how we're going to update our AXI FSM in the cache :

![New axi fsm to add manual flush](../user_docs/docs/images/updated_fsm_axi_csr.jpg)

As you can see, we now shall switch to write-back is we recieve `csr_flush_order` and the `csr_flushing` register (which is set to 1 when `csr_flush_order` is recieved) will condition the skipping of the read sequence. Here is the timing diagram as a reminder:

![flushing timing diagram](../user_docs/docs/images/flush_timing.png)

### 8.2.a : HDL Code

```

### 8.2.b : Verification

Verification is very straight forward :

- We grab our test file where we left it
- We assert the `csr_flush_order` flag like the user wants to flush
- And we simply check that the cache initiates write_back by checking the AXI FSM states
- Also check the `csr_flushing` register bahvior and read bypass system.

```python
# test_holy_cache.py

# ... Other tests ...

    # ==================================
    # MANUAL FLUSH TEST
    # ==================================

    # do nothing for a bit
    await Timer(100, units="ns")
    await RisingEdge(dut.clk)

    # The user decides to manually fush the core
    dut.cache_system.csr_flush_order.value = 0b1
    await Timer(1, units="ns")
    # cach is dirty so next state shall be WRITE
    assert dut.cache_system.cache_dirty.value == 0b1
    assert dut.cache_system.next_state.value == SENDING_WRITE_REQ
    assert dut.cpu_cache_stall.value == 0b1

    await RisingEdge(dut.aclk) # STATE SWITCH !
    await Timer(1, units="ns")

    assert dut.cache_system.state.value == SENDING_WRITE_REQ
    assert dut.cache_system.csr_flushing.value == 0b1
    assert dut.axi_awvalid.value == 0b1
    assert dut.axi_arready.value == 0b1

    while not dut.cache_system.state.value == WAITING_WRITE_RES:
        # wait for next IDLE state
        await RisingEdge(dut.aclk)
        await Timer(1, units="ns")

    await RisingEdge(dut.aclk)
    await Timer(1, units="ns")
    # after WB flush, we go straight to IDLE and bypass read
    assert dut.axi_bvalid.value == 0b1
    assert dut.axi_bresp.value == 0b00
    assert dut.cache_system.csr_flushing.value == 0b1
    assert dut.cache_system.next_csr_flushing.value == 0b0
    assert dut.cache_system.next_state.value == IDLE

    # csr flushin should be low again
    await RisingEdge(dut.aclk)
    await Timer(1, units="ns")
    assert dut.cache_system.csr_flushing.value == 0b0

    # And so on ...

```

## 8.3 : Adapting the `control` module for `Zicsr`

Before moving on the the "assemble everything" part, we shall not forget to **DECODE** CSR instructions ! A little reminder shall we ?

| csr          | rs1 / unsigned imm | f3  | rd    | op      |
| ------------ | ------------------ | --- | ----- | ------- |
| XXXXXXXXXXXX | XXXXX              | XXX | XXXXX | 1110011 |

So we just have to decode the op... Yes, indeed but there's more to it. We also have to add the following control signals (outputs):

- `csr_write_enable`
- `csr_write_back_source`
- Add a new `imm_source`  to specify the 0 extended uimm from bits [19:16]
  - and that means we'll have to make a quick update on the sign extender after that
- add a new `write_back_source` variant, making it a 3 bits wide signal
  - and yes, that means a handful of changes todo !

So let's go ! there is not time to lose !

### 8.3.a : HDL Code

For the control, life is good, no fancy logic and just some nice case to fill. but **don't forget the default value** of our new sigals ! E.g. we wouln't want `csr_write_enable` to be asseted on an other unrelated instruction !

> Also, don't forget do add the new OP code to the `holy_core_pkg.sv` file ! We'll call it `OPCODE_CSR`. Side note, in later editions, this signal will be renames "OPCODE_SYSTEM".

```verilog
// holy_core_pkg.sv

// ...

// INSTRUCTION OP CODES
  typedef enum logic [6:0] {
    OPCODE_R_TYPE         = 7'b0110011,
    OPCODE_I_TYPE_ALU     = 7'b0010011,
    OPCODE_I_TYPE_LOAD    = 7'b0000011,
    OPCODE_S_TYPE         = 7'b0100011,
    OPCODE_B_TYPE         = 7'b1100011,
    OPCODE_U_TYPE_LUI     = 7'b0110111,
    OPCODE_U_TYPE_AUIPC   = 7'b0010111,
    OPCODE_J_TYPE         = 7'b1101111,
    OPCODE_J_TYPE_JALR    = 7'b1100111,
    OPCODE_CSR            = 7'b1110011
  } opcode_t;

// ...
```

Then we get to modifying control :

```verilog
// control.sv

module control (
    // IN ..

    // OUT
    // ...
    output logic [2:0] write_back_source, // CHANGED !
    // ...
    output logic csr_write_back_source,   // NEW !
    output logic csr_write_enable         // NEW !
);

// ...

/**
* MAIN DECODER
*/

// ...

    case (op)

        // ... with csr_write_enable = 1'b0
        // added everywhere else; (NEW !)

        // CSR instructions (SYSTEM OPCODE)
        OPCODE_CSR : begin
            imm_source = 3'b101;
            mem_write = 1'b0;
            reg_write = 1'b1;
            write_back_source = 3'b100
            // Determine wb src from MSB of F3
            // 3'b0xx is for rs value
            // 3'b1xx is for imm extended value
            csr_write_back_source = func3[2];
            csr_write_enable = 1'b1;
        end
        // EVERYTHING ELSE
        default: begin
            // Don't touch the CPU nor MEMORY state, including CSR
            reg_write = 1'b0;
            mem_write = 1'b0;
            mem_read = 1'b0;
            jump = 1'b0;
            branch = 1'b0;
            csr_write_enable = 1'b0;
            $display("Unknown/Unsupported OP CODE !");
        end
    endcase

// ...
```

Don't forget we are writing to the main registers as well ! (because we store the old value in a destination register !)

### 8.3.b : Verification

Now, it's only a matter of small adaptations:

1. Replace old 2bit write `write_back_source` as 3bits wide
2. check if all previous tests still passes
3. add our new simple assetion check test

For clarity, I'll just show the new test here :

```python
# test_control.py

# Other tests ...

@cocotb.test()
async def csr_control_test(dut):
    await set_unknown(dut)
    # TEST CONTROL SIGNALS FOR CSR Instructions

    # with F3 = 0xx
    await Timer(10, units="ns")
    dut.op.value = 0b1110011 # SYSTEM
    dut.func3.value = 0b0
    await Timer(1, units="ns")

    assert dut.imm_source.value == "101"
    assert dut.mem_read.value == "0"
    assert dut.mem_write.value == "0"
    assert dut.reg_write.value == "1"
    assert dut.branch.value == "0"
    assert dut.jump.value == "0"
    assert dut.pc_source.value == "0"
    assert dut.write_back_source.value == "100" # to be adapted everywhere !
    assert dut.csr_write_enable == "1"
    assert dut.csr_write_back_source.value == "0"

    # with F3 = 0xx
    await Timer(10, units="ns")
    dut.op.value = 0b1110011 # SYSTEM
    dut.func3.value = 0b100
    await Timer(1, units="ns")
    assert dut.csr_write_back_source.value == "1"

```

## 8.4 : Quick update on the `sign_extender` module

To take our new `imm_source` (*0b101*) into account, we shall update out `signext.sv` file.

### 8.4.a : HDL Code

Here is the entire updated module :

```verilog
// signext.sv

module signext (
    // IN
    input logic [24:0] raw_src,
    // ...
);

always_comb begin
    case (imm_source)

        // ...

        // CSR instrs
        3'b101 : immediate = {{27{1'b0}}, raw_src[12:8]}; // NEW !

        default: immediate = 32'd0;
    endcase
end

endmodule
```

### 8.4.b : Verification

And to verify we shall simply add a test that does as always :

- chosses a random imm
- shift it to place it in the instruction (with OP excluded because never use for imm => `raw_data`)
- add `random_junk` to provoke errors if we set things up wrong
- tests for expected value.
  - Here we ONLY zero extend a continuous 5 bits immidiate. So its value should be the same as we started with.

```python
# test_signext.py

# other tests ...

@cocotb.test()
async def zero_ext_csr_test(dut):
    # 100 randomized tests
    for _ in range(100):
        imm = random.randint(0b00000, 0b11111)
        init_imm_value = imm
        imm <<= (5 + 3) # shift it RD + F3 Spaces
        source = 0b101
        random_junk = 0b111111111111_00000_111_11111
        raw_data = random_junk | imm
        await Timer(1, units="ns")
        dut.raw_src.value = raw_data
        dut.imm_source.value = source
        await Timer(1, units="ns") # let it propagate ...
        assert dut.immediate.value == init_imm_value
```

Good, now we have everything we need to implement our CSR regfile. Next step : implement a new datapath, make the previous tests pass again an write a new test program !

## 8.5 : Datapath modifications for `Zicsr`

Alright so here what we aim to implement under the form of a nice scheme :

![datapath with CSR regfile](../user_docs/docs/images/added_csr.jpg)

As you can see, there a bit of work to do ! We have to :

- Declare the CSR module
  - and declare all its signals !
- Route the flush orders correctly the the *HOLY Data Cache*
- Adapt `write_back_source`'s width and update the write back MUX logic
- Add a new csr write back mux
- And a few more little things, but it comes up naturally as we implement it, no worries

Our first objective is to wire up all this and then make the old tests pass again.

### 8.5.a : HDL Code

Here are the highlights of the updated datapath :

```verilog
// holy_core.sv

module holy_core (
    // ...
);
/**
* CONTROL
*/

// ... already existing signals declarations
wire csr_write_back_source;  // NEW !

control control_unit(
    // ... NEw !
    .csr_write_back_source(csr_write_back_source),
    .csr_write_enable(csr_write_enable),
    // ...
);

/// ... (Regfile with updated write_back source width) ...

/**
* SIGN EXTEND
*/

// ...

/**
* CSR REGFILE (NEW !)
*/

logic [31:0] csr_write_back_data;
logic [31:0] csr_write_data;
always_comb begin : csr_wb_mux
    if(~csr_write_back_source) begin
        csr_write_back_data = read_reg1;
    end else begin
        csr_write_back_data = immediate;
    end
end

logic [11:0] csr_address;
assign csr_address = instruction[31:20];
logic [31:0] csr_read_data;
logic csr_write_enable;
logic csr_flush_order;

csr_file holy_csr_file(
    //in
    .clk(clk),
    .rst_n(rst_n),
    .f3(f3),
    .write_data(csr_write_back_data),
    .write_enable(csr_write_enable),
    .address(csr_address),
    //out
    .read_data(csr_read_data),
    .flush_cache_flag(csr_flush_order)
);

// ...

endmodule
```

And it's not shown here but don't forget to add an input the the data cache module for `flush_cache_order`.

### 8.5.b : Verification

To verify, we'll create a simple test program that will check the behavior of the CSR cache flush and the core's reaction to such an order (_asserted to be an initation of the write back / read sequence depending on cache state_)

The test program is extremely simple :

```txt
// test_imemory.hex

// other tests...

00100A13  //CSR FLUSH TEST :    addi x20 x0 0x1     | x20 <= 00000001
7C0A1AF3  //                    csrrw x21 0x7C0 x20 | x21 <= 00000000 
// (flush_cache <= 00000001 / + WRITE BACK + RELOAD !)

// NOPs...
```

What we do is simply load the value : `x20 <= 0x1` and then use the `csrrw` instruction to do `x21 <= CSR <= x20`.

And you guessed it, after that, `flush_cache` CSR will be 1, thus flushing the cache and x21 should be 0 as this was the `flush_cache` CSR's value before the test.

Here is the tb, which is pretty much what we just described :

```python
# test_holy_core.py

# others tests ...

    ################
    # CSR TESTS (FLUSH_CACHE)
    # 00100A13  //CSR FLUSH TEST :    addi x20 x0 0x1     | x20 <= 00000001
    # 7C0A1AF3  //                    csrrw x21 0x7C0 x20 | x21 <= 00000000
    # (flush_cache <= 00000001 / + WRITE BACK + RELOAD !)
    ##################

    # Check test init's state
    assert binary_to_hex(dut.core.regfile.registers[21].value) == "0000DEAD"
    assert binary_to_hex(dut.core.instruction.value) == "00100A13"

    await RisingEdge(dut.clk) # addi x20 x0 0x1
    assert binary_to_hex(dut.core.regfile.registers[20].value) == "00000001"

    await RisingEdge(dut.clk) # csrrw x21 0x7C0 x20
    await Timer(2,units="ns") # csrrw x21 0x7C0 x20
    # value in CSR was 0...
    assert binary_to_hex(dut.core.regfile.registers[21].value) == "00000000" 

    assert dut.core.stall.value == 0b1
    assert dut.core.data_cache.state.value == SENDING_READ_REQ

    # Wait for the cache to retrieve data
    while(dut.core.stall.value == 0b1) :
        await RisingEdge(dut.clk)

    # At the end of the stall, CSR should be back to 0
    assert dut.core.stall.value == 0b0
    assert binary_to_hex(dut.core.holy_csr_file.flush_cache.value) == "00000000"

```

note the `while(dut.core.stall.value == 0b1)` which waits fot the end of the flush

## 9 : Testing our new CSR functionnality live on FPGA

Remember our old `test.s` program to blink leds ?

```c
# test.S

.section .text
.align 2
.global _start

start:
    # Initialization
    lui x6, 0x2                 # Load GPIO base address
    addi x19, x0, 0x0           # Set offset to 0
    addi x20, x0, 0x80          # Set offset limit to 128 (i.e., cache size)
    addi x18, x0, 0
    j loop

loop:
    # reset offsets
    addi x6, x0, 0
    lui x6, 0x2                 # Load GPIO base address
    addi x19, x0, 0x0           # Set offset to 0

    addi x18, x18, 0x1
    j sub_loop

sub_loop:
    sw x18, 0(x6)
    addi x6, x6, 0x4
    addi x19, x19, 0x1
    bne x19, x20, sub_loop

    lw x23, 0(x0)               # Done! Create a cache miss to write back.

    # Delay loop: Wait for ~50,000,000 clock cycles
    li x21, 50000000      # Load 50,000,000 into x21

delay_loop:
    addi x21, x21, -1           # Decrement x21
    bnez x21, delay_loop        # If x21 != 0, continue looping

    j loop                      # Restart the loop
```

Well, it was kinda chaotic because we had to write the whole cache due to weird AXI_LITE address wrap side effects (thus the `sub_loop`) and we also have this lonely `lw x23, 0(x0)` that served as a "manual cache miss provoker".

Well, we can just replace `lw x23, 0(x0)` by `csrrwi x0, 0x7C0, 0x1` which write a 1 into the CSR dedicated to this and create a cache write back without weird cache miss shenanigan !

> Fixing the AXI LITE address wrap stuff is SoC matter for later, for now, we stick to using our CSR to test it.

Now, we can run the `make` command in `fpga_edition/fpga/test_programs/` which will translate `test.s` into a `test.hex` hexdump, copy paste that hex program into a tcl custom program loader :

```tcl
# blink_led_csr.tcl

reset_hw_axi [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1]
set bram_address 0x00000000
set wt axi_bram_wt
create_hw_axi_txn $wt [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1] -type write -address $bram_address -len 20 -data {
    00002337
    00000993
    08000a13
    00000913
    0040006f
    00000313
    00002337
    00000993
    00190913
    0040006f
    01232023
    00430313
    00198993
    ff499ae3
    7c00d073
    02fafab7
    080a8a93
    fffa8a93
    fe0a9ee3
    fc9ff06f
}

run_hw_axi [get_hw_axi_txns $wt]

set rt axi_bram_rt
create_hw_axi_txn $rt [get_hw_axis hw_axi_1] -type read -address $bram_address -len 20
run_hw_axi [get_hw_axi_txns $rt]
```

and run `vivado -source fpga_edition/fpga/zybo_z720/holy_vivado_setup.tcl` to create the project, flash the board, run the tcl loader and release rest to see that our LEDs are bliking like before !

## 10 : Further improving the cache by adding non cachable ranges by leveraging `Zicsr`.

> I recommend you get yourself up to speed on AXI LITE for this part, which is lite AXI, just simpler.

Okay, now let's talk about another problem we talked about and chose to forget : MMIO interaction.

Yes, offering the possibility to the user to clear cache manually technically helps with interact with MMIO peripherals but in reality, when we interact with MMIO stuff, we often want real time, atomic interaction, making cache an obstacle more than an helper. Heck ! even blinking a simple LED is a hastle when having to deal with a fixed and stubborn cache system !

So a good option would be to allow the user to just **bypass** the cache on a specific range, specified in runtime using CSRs, allowing for a great flexibility.

When it comes to external, single beat data transactions, **AXI LITE** is is a good option.

So whenever the requested data (being *read* or *write*) is in the specified **non-cachable range**, our cache shall make a single transaction using **AXI LITE** instead of oving whole blocks of data. Here are the 2 CSRs we should define so the user can specify the said range:

- `non_cachable_base`
- `non_cachable_limit`

And we would determine wether or not the asked data shall be cached or not using logic that looks like this : `non_cachable_flag = (addr >= mmio_base) && (addr < mmio_limit)`

And regardles of what we do on this range (`lw`, `sw`, etc...), the cache will

1. Stall the cpu
2. Require data though AXI Lite
3. Return data once it's there

And doing so, it will completely bypass the **AXI** states (READ_REQ, READ_DATA, ...) and rather go in a new set of **AXI_LITE** states that should takes less time and, most importantly, provide direct access to MMIOs without caching.

So let's also think about the changes we'll have to do to make this happen :

- Add the CSRs in the `csr_file`, and output the ranges values
- Create an **AXI_LITE** interface definition.
- Update the `holy_cache` state machine and logic for `non_cachable` data requests.
- Verify: Make sure old tb still passes and implement new **AXI_LITE** tb
- Implement changes in the *HOLY_CORE* datapath
- Verify behavior in *HOLY_CORE*'s testbench
- Test live on the FPGA chip with yet another a blinking LED programs

It's quite a bit of work, but it's worth it as we'll have a mostly usable core after that and we'll be able to focus on... well, actually **using** it !

## 10.1 : Updating the `csr_file`

First of all, les't add our couple of new CSRs to the CSR file and test their behavior.

### 10.1.a : HDL Code

Adding simple R/W CSRs is pretty straightforward (yes, I **always** write that, I know, but it's true most of the time). *But* remember we gotta declare each CSR **individually** :

```verilog
module csr_file (
    // IN
    input logic clk,
    input logic rst_n,
    input logic [2:0] f3,
    input logic [31:0] write_data,
    input logic write_enable,
    input logic [11:0] address,

    // OUT DATA
    output logic [31:0] read_data,

    // OUT CSR SIGNALS
    output logic flush_cache_flag,
    output logic [31:0]  non_cachable_base_addr,
    output logic [31:0]  non_cachable_limit_addr
);

// Declare all CSRs and they next signals here
logic [31:0] flush_cache, next_flush_cache;                 // 0x7C0
logic [31:0] non_cachable_base, next_non_cachable_base;     // 0x7C1 NEW !
logic [31:0] non_cachable_limit, next_non_cachable_limit;   // 0x7C2 NEW !

always_ff @(posedge clk) begin
    if(~rst_n) begin
        // CHANGED !
        flush_cache <= 32'd0;
        non_cachable_base <= 32'd0;
        non_cachable_limit <= 32'd0;
    end
    else begin
        // CHANGED !
        flush_cache <= next_flush_cache;
        non_cachable_base <= next_non_cachable_base;
        non_cachable_limit <= next_non_cachable_limit;
    end
end

// Specific CSRs logics
always_comb begin
    // ----------------------------
    // Flush cache CSR

    if(flush_cache_flag) begin
        next_flush_cache = 32'd0; // if we sent the flush flag, reset on the next cycle
    end
    else if (write_enable & (address == 12'h7C0))begin
        next_flush_cache = write_back_to_csr;
    end
    else begin
        next_flush_cache = flush_cache;
    end

    // ----------------------------
    // cachable base and limit CSR (NEW !)

    next_non_cachable_base = non_cachable_base;
    if (write_enable & (address == 12'h7C1)) begin
        next_non_cachable_base = write_back_to_csr;
    end

    next_non_cachable_limit = non_cachable_limit;
    if (write_enable & (address == 12'h7C2)) begin
        next_non_cachable_limit = write_back_to_csr;
    end
end

// Always output the CSR data at the given address (or 0)
always_comb begin
    case (address)
        12'h7C0: read_data = flush_cache;
        12'h7C1: read_data = non_cachable_base; // NEW !
        12'h7C2: read_data = non_cachable_limit; // NEW !
        default: read_data = 32'd0;
    endcase
end

// Compute next CSR possible values
logic [31:0] or_result;
logic [31:0] nand_result;

always_comb begin
    // TODO side quest : we could use the already existing ALU to save space here...
    // ... mais j'ai la flemme là...
    or_result = write_data | read_data;
    nand_result = read_data & (~write_data);
end

// Select value using F3
logic [31:0] write_back_to_csr; // NEW !

always_comb begin
    case (f3)
        3'b001, 3'b101 : write_back_to_csr = write_data;
        3'b010, 3'b110 : write_back_to_csr = or_result;
        3'b011, 3'b111 : write_back_to_csr = nand_result;
        default : begin
            write_back_to_csr = 32'd0;
        end
    endcase
end

// output control signals
always_comb begin : control_assignments
    flush_cache_flag = flush_cache[0];
    non_cachable_base_addr = non_cachable_base; // NEW !
    non_cachable_limit_addr = non_cachable_limit; // NEW !
end

endmodule
```

### 10.1.b : Verification

For verification , we can simply take the existing testbench and add the new CSRs address so the R/W test applies automatically. Then we also check if the output signals are correctly bound to the CSRs:

```python
# test_csr_file.py

cocotb.test()
async def test_csr_file(dut):
    # Start a 10 ns clock
    cocotb.start_soon(Clock(dut.clk, 10, units="ns").start())

    # map each address to a register
    def get_csr_value(addr):
        if(addr == 0x7C0):
            return dut.flush_cache.value
        elif(addr == 0x7C1):
            return dut.non_cachable_base.value
        elif(addr == 0x7C2):
            return dut.non_cachable_limit.value
        else:
            return 0

    for addr in [0x7C0, 0x7C1, 0x7C2]:
        # ...

    # ------------------------------
    # CACHE BASE

    await RisingEdge(dut.clk)
    # write stuff to the cache base
    dut.write_enable.value = 1
    dut.address.value = 0x7C1
    dut.write_data.value = 0xAEAEAEAE
    dut.f3.value = 0b001
    await RisingEdge(dut.clk)
    await Timer(2, units="ns")
    # check the output towards cache indicates good value
    assert dut.non_cachable_base_addr.value == 0xAEAEAEAE

    # ------------------------------
    # CACHE LIMIT

    await RisingEdge(dut.clk)
    # write stuff to the cache base
    dut.write_enable.value = 1
    dut.address.value = 0x7C2
    dut.write_data.value = 0xAEAEAEAE
    dut.f3.value = 0b001
    await RisingEdge(dut.clk)
    await Timer(2, units="ns")
    # check the output towards cache indicates good value
    assert dut.non_cachable_limit_addr.value == 0xAEAEAEAE
```

## 12.2 Updating the cache to add a bypassing mechanism

Well, here is the core of the work we'll have to perform to make this improvement a reality... So let's setlle our logic on a nice scheme first...

![holy data cache scheme](../user_docs/docs/images/data_cache.jpg)

A bit of explaination : Here are the point of attetion that will change compared to the last cache subystem :

- We compare the requested address to CSRs to determine "cachability" of the data
  - side note : we compare the TAG of the CSR addresses, meaning the user cannot specify a range lower that a 128 words block or misaligned on 128 words. If the dev ignres that, the data may be cached anyway. We assume the end user will define ranges larger than 512 Bytes.
- We add an **AXI LITE** dimension to our FSM *(new states but shared IDLE)*
- For non cachable data, we declare a single register used to return the read result from **AXI_LITE**.
- We use the `non_cachable` signal to select the `read_data` we want to return.
- stalling mecanism is **already implemented** : because we share the same FSM, the cache will stall as soon as the next decided state is not IDLE (eg going into AXI LITE transaction states), **but** we'll also declare a `axi_lite_tx_done` bool register to track when the transaction is finished to de assert the `stall` and avoid dealocking.

> More of the FSM modifications later.

### 12.2.a : HDL Code

First, we have to create a whole new `holy_data_cache.sv` file and the tb that goes with it by copy pasting the "old" cache (mostly renaming stuff and modules).

> We create a new file as we want to keep the **AXI** only *holy cache* for the instruction cache for now.

Let's start by declaring the `axi_lite_if.sv` interface in the `pkg/` folder :

```verilog
// axi_lite_if.sv

interface axi_lite_if #(
    parameter ADDR_WIDTH = 32,
    parameter DATA_WIDTH = 32
);

    // Global signals
    logic aclk;
    logic aresetn;

    // Write Address Channel
    logic [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] awaddr;
    logic awvalid;
    logic awready;

    // Write Data Channel
    logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] wdata;
    logic [(DATA_WIDTH/8)-1:0] wstrb;
    logic wvalid;
    logic wready;

    // Write Response Channel
    logic [1:0] bresp;
    logic bvalid;
    logic bready;

    // Read Address Channel
    logic [ADDR_WIDTH-1:0] araddr;
    logic arvalid;
    logic arready;

    // Read Data Channel
    logic [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] rdata;
    logic [1:0] rresp;
    logic rvalid;
    logic rready;

    // Master modport
    modport master (
        input  aclk,
        input  aresetn,

        output awaddr,
        output awvalid,
        input  awready,

        output wdata,
        output wstrb,
        output wvalid,
        input  wready,

        input  bresp,
        input  bvalid,
        output bready,

        output araddr,
        output arvalid,
        input  arready,

        input  rdata,
        input  rresp,
        input  rvalid,
        output rready
    );

    // Slave modport
    modport slave (
        input  aclk,
        input  aresetn,

        input  awaddr,
        input  awvalid,
        output awready,

        input  wdata,
        input  wstrb,
        input  wvalid,
        output wready,

        output bresp,
        output bvalid,
        input  bready,

        input  araddr,
        input  arvalid,
        output arready,

        output rdata,
        output rresp,
        output rvalid,
        input  rready
    );

endinterface
```

> Don't forget to include it the `tb/holy_data_cache/make` file
 (and test runner if you have one) !

And then start declaring the basic signals we'll need to make our new cache work according to our scheme (we keep the FSM for later for now):

> Don't forget, we now work in a copied version of the `holy_cache` that we named `holy_data_cache.sv` !

```verilog
// holy_data_cache.sv

    assign non_cachable = (
        (req_block_tag >= non_cachable_base[31:9])

    );

    logic [31:0]                    axi_lite_read_result; 

    // (UNCHANGED !)

        // INCOMING CACHE REQUEST SIGNALS
        logic [31:9]                    req_block_tag;

Now let's think about how all of this is going to come together. How ? Well, most of it relies in our FSM design ! Let's detail our vision for how it would work :

![NEW FSM with axi lite scheme](../user_docs/docs/images/axi_lite_fsm.jpg)

As you can see, this logic got added to the previous FSM, which makes way more sense. Lookin at this new FSM, the cache logic becomes way clearer and now it's mostly a matter of nailing the muxes and RTL right to makes all these ideas go smoothly.

So let's declare these new FSM states in the `holy_core_pkg.sv` file :

```verilog
typedef enum logic [3:0] { 
    IDLE, // Acts as simple BRAM array
    // AXI FULL STATES
    SENDING_WRITE_REQ,
    SENDING_WRITE_DATA,
    WAITING_WRITE_RES,
    SENDING_READ_REQ, // Data miss ! We have to fetch from memory ! State for as long as the req has not been acknowleged by memory slave
    RECEIVING_READ_DATA,  // Once REQ is acknowleged, we wait for full response. (tlast)
    // AXI LITE VERSIONS
    LITE_SENDING_WRITE_REQ,
    LITE_SENDING_WRITE_DATA,
    LITE_WAITING_WRITE_RES,
    LITE_SENDING_READ_REQ,
    LITE_RECEIVING_READ_DATA
} cache_state_t;
```

And now, we use our FSM and AXI Lite knowledge to build the FSM STATES LOGIC in RTL and use our sceheme to setup the different signals to make our logic work smoothly :

```verilog
// holy_core_pkg.sv

package holy_core_pkg;

  typedef enum logic [3:0] {
      IDLE, // Acts as simple BRAM array
      // AXI FULL STATES
      SENDING_WRITE_REQ,
      SENDING_WRITE_DATA,
      WAITING_WRITE_RES,
      SENDING_READ_REQ,
      RECEIVING_READ_DATA,
      // AXI LITE VERSIONS (NEW !)
      LITE_SENDING_WRITE_REQ,
      LITE_SENDING_WRITE_DATA,
      LITE_WAITING_WRITE_RES,
      LITE_SENDING_READ_REQ,
      LITE_RECEIVING_READ_DATA
  } cache_state_t;

  // ...
```

And now we "simply" (even though it's not trivial) apply our FSM logic in HDL :

```verilog
// holy_data_cache.sv

// ... all the rest

// =======================
    // READ & MAIN FSM LOGIC
    // =======================

        axi.wlast = 1'b0;
        // the data being send is always set, "ready to go"
        axi.wdata = cache_data[set_ptr];
        cache_state = state;
        next_set_ptr = set_ptr;

        // AXI LITE DEFAULT
        axi_lite.wstrb = 4'b1111; // we write all by default.

        next_csr_flushing = csr_flushing;

        case (state)
            IDLE: begin

So we improved our `IDLE LOGIC` to take into account the new type of transition towards the `LITE` states and implemented the `LITE` states by simply copy-pasting the old `AXI` states and adapting to `AXI_LITE` as both are pretty much the same except for bursts.

We also adapted the address source we send an the `aw` and `ar` channels as now, the cache block is pretty much irrelevant.

This results in a data cache where cachable and uncachable logic are well separated by handling the transaction via completely defferent states.

### 12.2.b : Verification

To verify this, the test follow the same logic as previous cache states. We provoke R/W transaction and follow along with assetions on the expected behavior and hopefully the tests passes.

**BUT** before writting any test... we need ta *adapt* our test bench to :

1. Add the new axi_lite interface to our `axi_translator.sv` test harness for cocotb
2. In cocotb, using the `cocotbext.axi` python package, we have to declare a new `AXI_LITE` RAM Slave

The objective now is to put the whole test in a loop, so we create a cache miss by setting the tag to a big address, as the very first test is expected to miss.

Doing this loop is an easy and fast way to make sure using the non cachable range does not mess up things (states or boolean registers) that would make regular caching fail afterwards:

```python
# test_holy_data_cache.py

# ...

for _ in range(10) :
    # Set cachable range to 0 for now to fully test the cache
    dut.cache_system.non_cachable_base.value = 0x0000_0000
    dut.cache_system.non_cachable_limit.value = 0x0000_0000


    # and we go on ...
```

And it works ! Great !

But that's not it ! We have to make a final modification to our cache for it to work with our datapath !

> But... Why ?

Great question, glad you asked. Hold on, it's almost over!

Our data cache works great and as expected but for it to work int the *HOLY CORE*, we'll need to tweak it slighly to take stalling side effects in account.

The reason why is that when we fetch a `sw` for example, the cache will **STALL** because the next state is not going to be IDLE and the fetch the data. Once it's back at IDLE, the core does not behave like our tb : **The `sw` instruction is still being fetched** as the core was stalled the whole time, waiting for the cache to sop being busy.

What does that mean ? well the cache now want to restart all over again (because all it sees is the data request) to get the data through AXI LITE and it keeps stalling... **forever**.

How do we solve this problem ? Well we'll add a `axi_lite_tx_done` flag to our cache to validate the data and allow the cache to know the requested data is good to go and de-assert stall.

In a nutshell :

- Add an `axi_lite_tx_done` flag to cache and use it to :
  - cancel stall
  - stop cache from transitionning into LITE states for 1 clock cycle.

> yes, preventing the stall for 1 cycle is not ultra robust, but due to the simplicity of the core, this will do just fine for now.

Here is an updated scheme for our cache :

![data cache with done flag scheme](../user_docs/docs/images/data_cache_with_done_flag.jpg)

As you can see, we also bring our `non_cachable` to the hit logic to avoid side effects where the cache thinks we are missing and stalls the core after `axi_lite_tx_done` goes low because of `seq_stall`, which, _if you remember correctly_, have a 1 cycle delay. Keeping hit high on non cachable operation prevents such behavior. (Note the _holy_cache_'stest has been slightly modified for this bug fix by adding assertions on the `cache_stall` signal and changing the requested address on the non cachble data transactions tests, nothing fancy.)

Now let's implement it in the cache logic :

```verilog
// holy_data_cache.sv

module holy_data_cache #(
    parameter CACHE_SIZE = 128
)(
    // I/Os ...
);
    // ...

    // IMPORTANT : axi_lite_tx_done is flag used to determine
    // if R or W tx has been completed
    // it is set to 1 after a successful AXI LITE TX to avoid going into a
    // NON IDLE state right away
    // and let the core fetch a new instruction.
    // This also means it stays high for 1 clock cycle only before going low again
    // thus allwing the cache
    // to go NON-IDLE again on the non cachable range.
    logic                           axi_lite_tx_done, next_axi_lite_tx_done; // NEW !

    // ...

    // STALL LOGIC
    // ...
    assign cache_stall = (comb_stall | seq_stall) && ~axi_lite_tx_done; // CHANGED !

    // HIT LOGIC
    logic hit;
    // CHANGED ! (BRH BUG FIX)
    assign hit = ((req_block_tag == cache_block_tag) && cache_valid) | non_cachable;

    // =======================

    cache_state_t state, next_state;

    // MAIN CLOCK DRIVEN SEQ LOGIC
    always_ff @(posedge clk) begin

            // ...
            axi_lite_tx_done <= 1'b0; // NEW !
        end else begin
            //...

        case (state)

            end
        endcase
    end
    //...
endmodule
```

We verify that old tests still passes well (may have to make 1 adjustment on a timing issue by simply waiting an addition clock cycle for `axi_lite_tx_done` to auto reset and also add a few assertions to verify its behavior... But I'll let you handle that :-} )

## 12.3 : Updating the datapath for the uncachable range

### 12.3.a : HDL Code

As always, we simply wire things up for the data path, so I am not going to give the code to you this time ;). Rest assured, it's "business as usual".

Here is a list of thing you have to watch out for for this specific datapath implementation :

- Declare the `axi_lite_if`
  - In the data path (just like the full axi)
  - And in the test harnesses
- Don't forget to update cache state to 4 bits
  - for the testbench files
  - but also for the actual FPGA debug wire (_if you have your own_)
- Link address ranges from `csr_file` to `data_cache`.
- Don't forget rename the data cache module `holy_cache` -> `holy_data_cache` in the datapath HDL
- Add `axi_lite_if` import to the tb's make file

And now we're all set to move on to verifying this !

### 12.3.b : Verification

The test is once agin pretty straight forward, we'll follow olong with a test program and assertion, hoping everything goes "according to plan".

Before hoping to the tb additions and modifications, let's agree on a test program :

```txt
// test_imemory.hex

// .. other tests ...

00000A13  //CSR $ RANGE TEST :  addi x20 x0 0x0     | x20 <= 00000000
00002A37  //                    lui x20 0x2         | x20 <= 00002000
200A0A93  //                    addi x21 x20 0x200  | x21 <= 00002200
7C1A1073  //                    csrrw x0 0x7C1 x20  | non_cachable_base <= 00002000
7C2A9073  //                    csrrw x0 0x7C2 x21  | non_cachable_limit <= 00002200
004A0A13  //                    addi x20 x20 0x4    | x20 <= 00002004
ABCD1B37  //                    lui x22 0xABCD1     | x22 <= ABCD1000
111B0B13  //                    addi x22 x22 0x111  | x22 <= ABCD1111
016A2023  //                    sw x22 0(x20)       | mem @ 0x2004 <= ABCD1111 / AXI LITE TX
004A2B03  //                    lw x22 4(x20)       | x22 <= 00000000 / AXI LITE TX
000A2B03  //                    lw x22 0(x20)       | x22 <= ABCD1111 / AXI LITE TX

// .. NOPs ...
```

So as you can see, we :

1. Prepare some constants (non cachable range)
2. Write these to the CSRs
3. Execute store / loads on this new non cachable range.

The goal will be to verify that everython behaves smoothly on the CPU side.

Here is the associated tb code :

```python
# test_holy_core.py

# update imports
from cocotbext.axi import AxiBus, AxiRam, AxiLiteBus, AxiLiteRam

@cocotb.test()

    axi_ram_slave = AxiRam(
        AxiBus.from_prefix(dut, "m_axi"),
        dut.aclk,
        dut.aresetn,
        size=SIZE,
        reset_active_level=False
    )
    axi_lite_ram_slave = AxiLiteRam(
        AxiLiteBus.from_prefix(dut, "m_axi_lite"),
        dut.aclk,
        dut.aresetn,
        size=SIZE,
        reset_active_level=False
    ) # Declare this !

And **voilà** ! we tested our feature and it *kinda* works ! Great ! Now let's test it on real FPGA.

## 13 : Testing the non cachable ranges on FPGA (LEDs)

Okay so to test in out on FPGA, it all depends on your FPGA and board. Here is what my LED test design looks like :

![new soc for design with axi lite if](../user_docs/docs/images/axi_soc2.png)

As you can see, **AXI LITE** and and **AXI FULL** use the same interconnect and thus axi lite can access any range (peripheral) as well as **AXI** full can.

I didn't extensively test this new cache solution on FPGA. **But so far**, the following works pretty well :

- Old manual cache miss still works
- Old csr cach flush design still works fine
- **New non cachable range works fine and with expected behavior !**

Here is the test program I then compiled and loaded in memory using, as always, the **JTAG to AXI-M** IP :

```c
.section .text
.align 2
.global _start

start:
    # Initialization
    lui x6, 0x2                 # 00002337 Load GPIO base address x6 <= 0x00002000
    lui x7, 0x2                 # same for x7 <= 0x00002000
    ori x7, x7, -1              # FFF3E393 set GPIO address limit x7 <= 0x00002FFF
    csrrw x0, 0x7C1, x6         # set base in csr
    csrrw x0, 0x7C2, x7         # set limit in csr
    addi x18, x0, 0             # 00000913 main counter, set to 0
    j loop                      # 0040006f

loop:
    addi x18, x18, 0x1          # 00190913 increment counter
    sw x18, 0(x6)               # 01232023 write new counter value to GPIO based address

    # Delay loop: Wait for 50,000,000 clock cycles = 1s @ 50Mhz
    li x21, 50000000            # 02fafab7 / 080a8a93 Load 50,000,000 into x21

delay_loop:
    addi x21, x21, -1           # fffa8a93 Decrement x21
    bnez x21, delay_loop        # fe0a9ee3 If x21 != 0, continue looping

    j loop                      # fd9ff06f Restart the loop
```

**And finally, after so many struglle, we finally have a clean way to make LEDs blink !**

Let's take a moment to celebrate and think about the future of this project...

What comes to mind.. Rest ? Taking a break ?

**WRONG !**

Let's finally print "**hello world**" !

## 14 : Hello, World ! (Hardware)

How does one make a CPU say "**hello world**" ? We'll use UART to send text data to a terminal on a host computer !

Well, we'll use an ip for that of course because I don't wanna drive an output pin though pure software and drivers (maybe later, but not now), nor I want to make my own IP for this as vivado already has one : **The UART-LITE IP !**

So let's drag and drop it to our SoC, while begin careful to map the addresses well and note them down to make sure we can set it as non cachable.

![SoC block design](../user_docs/docs/images/soc_hello.png)

![SoC addresses](../user_docs/docs/images/soc_hello_addr.png)

> Note : you can perfecly connect an AXI LITE master to an AXI FULL slave (contrary not possible). Connection automation will not do it for you though so you'll have to mannually add interfaces to the `smart_connect` block (you need that to assign addresses) and simply connect your devices as usual !

By running connection automation, vivado fills the uart pins with a weird "`uart_rtl`" port.

Don't be like me: _a fool_... Who though that "`uart_rtl`" meant my CPU would _magically_ use the UART embedded in the main USB's FTDI that the Zynq processing system uses.

**Turns out it doesn't**, so instead of looking around on how to highjack the FTDI chip from the PL, I'll just use a PMOD-USB module :

![pmod uart to usb](../user_docs/docs/images/uart_usb_being_used.png)

[_(clickable link to the docs)_](https://digilent.com/reference/pmod/pmodusbuart/reference-manual?redirect=1)

[_(clickable link to the schematics)_](https://digilent.com/reference/_media/reference/pmod/pmodusbuart/pmodusbuart_sch.pdf)

[_(clickable link to the digilent shop)_](https://digilent.com/shop/pmod-usbuart-usb-to-uart-interface/)

> Note : if you have an FPGA only chip with an FTDI chip on the PCB (e.g. arty-S7, arty-A7, basys3, etc..), you will **not** need a PMOD adapter, just find out what FPGA pins connect to the RX/TX of the FTDI chip and you'll be able to simply use the main cable !

Alright so we'll say we'll plug this nice little PCB in the JE PMOD upper female connector. Let's see which pin is which using the schematics :

![alt text](../user_docs/docs/images/pmod_schemes.png)

We can see that pins 1 to 4 of the PMOD are linked to pins JE1 to JE4 of the board.

And here is what the pins do on the PMOD Uart to USB pcb :

| Pin | Signal | Description                         |
| --- | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1   | `~RTS` | Request to Send Output (active low) |
| 2   | `RXD`  | Receive data from host to Pmod      |
| 3   | `TXD`  | Transmit data from Pmod to host     |
| 4   | `~CTS` | Clear to Send Input (active low)    |
| 5   | `GND`  | Power Supply Ground                 |
| 6   | `VCC`  | Power Supply                        |

Note that `~RTS` & `~CTS` are optional so we won't use it. And we can't anyway so let's dicard their existence.

Alright, we have all the information wee need ! only 2 pins to bind to be exact and we can move on to the sofware side of things.

Here is ho I improve the `constraints.xdc` file to line the `uart_rtl` outpouts generated by connection automation to the real, physical pin of the *"PMOD UART to USB"*.

> Small tip, in vivado, double click on the block design generated wrapper to get the detailled names of the `uart_rtl` output. for me its _uart_rtl_rxd_ and _uart_rtl_txd_.

```tcl
# constraints.xcd

# CONSTRAINT FILE FOR TARGET BOARD : ZYBO Z7-20 ONLY

# old constriants

set_property PACKAGE_PIN T16 [get_ports cpu_reset]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports cpu_reset]

set_property PACKAGE_PIN W13 [get_ports axi_reset]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports axi_reset]

# UART Constraints (NEW !)

# JE1 = RX input from host (USB-UART TX → FPGA RX)
set_property PACKAGE_PIN V12 [get_ports uart_rtl_rxd]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports uart_rtl_rxd]

# JE2 = TX output to host (FPGA TX → USB-UART RX)
set_property PACKAGE_PIN W16 [get_ports uart_rtl_txd]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS33 [get_ports uart_rtl_txd]
```

As you can see, JE1 is not really JE1 and same for JE2. You'll need to check your boards schematics to know the REAL FPGA pin name on the IO bank. Example :

![alt text](../user_docs/docs/images/io_bank_pin.png)

Looks like we are all set ! once you have a bitstream, we can

1. Check if our LED program still works _(did we break anything ?)_
2. Move on to writing our **_hello world_** program !

> Note : My JE PMOD did not work for some reason so I moved it to JB (the one on the picture above as I take pictures once things work). But the idea stays the same for your board / FPGA.

## 14 bis : Hello World ! (Software)

Okay, now we need to write **software** (*eww*) to make our hello world work.

To do so, we simply read our *AXI UART-LITE* IP's datasheet to figure out :

- What register to write the data we want to send (tx reg is `0x4` from base address and we only have acces to a byte)
- What register we can check to see if we can actually send data (status reg is `0x8` from base address and `tx_full` is the 4th bit flag / bit 3)

So here is the resulting assembly code :

```c
# hello.s

.section .text
.align 1
.global _start

_start:
    # Setup uncached MMIO region from 0x2000 to 0x2FFF
    lui x6, 0x0                 # x6 = 0x0000 => makes everything non cachable
    lui x7, 0x2
    ori x7, x7, -1              # x7 = 0x2FFF
    csrrw x0, 0x7C1, x6         # MMIO base
    csrrw x0, 0x7C2, x7         # MMIO limit

    # UARTLite base at 0x2800
    li x10, 0x2800              # x10 = UART base
    la x11, string              # x11 = address of string
    li x12, 13                  # x12 = length of string

loop:
    lb x13, 0(x11)              # load byte from string
wait:
    lw x14, 8(x10)              # read UART status (8h)
    andi x14, x14, 0x8          # test bit n°3 (TX FIFO not full)
    bnez x14, wait              # if not ready, spin
    sb x13, 4(x10)              # write byte to TX register (4h)

    addi x11, x11, 0x1          # next char
    addi x12, x12, -1           # decrement counter
    bnez x12, loop              # loop until done

    # Done
    j .

.section .rodata
.align 1
string:
    .asciz "Hello, World\n"
```

As you can see, our program gained in complexity as it now has a `.rodata` memory section. This is just a "high level" way to place data elements in memory. As we'll load this program in the BRAM, the data will also be included and the instruction will know where to look for it as its address will be hardcoded at compile time.

**BUT** to make a program that is not weird or anything *(compliant with our SoC architecture)*, we need to tell the compiler:

- How our memory is organized in our embedded system.
- Where does the sections (e.g. `.text` and `.data`) belong in this memory.

To do this we'll use a linker script, this way the hexdump will be compliant with our memory architecture :

```ld
// linker.ld

MEMORY {
    RAM (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 0x2000
}

SECTIONS {
    .text : {
        *(.text*)
    } > RAM
    .data : {
        *(.data*)
    } > RAM
    .bss : {
        *(.bss*)
    } > RAM
}
```

Now, we'll change our method a little to get our HEX dump. Before we used a disassemble version of the .text section. Which worked *"fine"* for **very** simple programs but not for this. Here we'll use our linker file alongside hexdump.

Here is a makefile that generates the `hello.hex` dump automatically :

```make
# test_programs/hello_world/Makefile

hello.hex: hello.elf
    riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -O binary hello.elf hello.bin
    hexdump -v -e '1/4 "%08x\n"' hello.bin > hello.hex
    rm -rf *.o *.elf *.bin

hello.elf: hello.s
    riscv64-unknown-elf-as -march=rv32i -mabi=ilp32 -g hello.s -o hello.o
    riscv64-unknown-elf-ld -m elf32lriscv -T linker.ld -o hello.elf hello.o

.PHONY: clean
clean:
    rm -rf *.o *.hex *.elf
```

And of course, as always, I use `riscv64-unknown-elf-XX` but using the right arguments, I can say tell the complier to interpret it as RV32I.

## 14 bis bis : loading the program and testing

Now, as always, we can program the board and load the program in the BRAM.

Expected behavior :

- The programs writes chars in the TX reg of the `UART LITE` ip
- The `UART LITE` ip sends UART signals to The **UART to USB** adapter
- The **UART to USB** adapter send this data to the host pc to which he's plugged in through USB
- Via a `tty` terminal, the host pc can see what the program was initially sending (we should see "**Hello, world**" and a newline)

To connect to the `tty` terminal via the host pc, multiple solution exists. I personnaly use **Putty** but **screen**, **minicom**, or whatever wil work just fine.

> Don't forget to set your baud rate ! `UART LITE` ip's default is 9 600.

Once the `tty` terminal is open, you can load the program in the BRAM using a `.tcl` script (Leveraging the JTAG to AXI MASTER IP as a bootloader once again) and realease the reset. Here is the result :

![hello world from HOLY CORE](../user_docs/docs/images/hello.png)

And finally, after all this work, after all this struggle, after all this learning, time designing; tinkering, fixing, enjoying and try-harding. Here it is...

**The _HOLY CORE_ said "Hello, World"**, gg wp.

## 15 : The end ?

Well... It may be the end of the FPGA Edition as you know know most of the things we need to run the core on FPGA.

## 15.1 : What's next ?

Well I have a big project comming up that will be the object of a YouTube video if I ever succeed.

For the _HOLY CORE_ itself, future planned work is :

- Software environement to use the _HOLY CORE_ on REAL small projects a.k.a. *HOLY CORE SOC AND SOFTWARE EDITION*.
  - We'll make the core Risc-V compliant
  - We'll add interrupt and exceptions support
  - We'll create a basic SoC for basic projects
  - We'll make some librairies for easy developement.
- A pipelined edition ? That's on my todo list as well.

## 15.2 : Some notes, from me to you.

If you made it here, thank you for reading me, I hope you learned stuff. And if you bought these as PDF, thank you so much for your trust and support.

A side note: Chances are more advanced stuff will only be available on a paid platform for multiple reasons. I feel like the 2 first editions are already a bit overwhelming and chances are that only a few people will arive here (without skipping stuff of course). I feel like turning the whole course into a less overwhelming and more comprehensive format, on a learning platform would be for the better and that adding avaced content to be **empoyable** would be the least I can do for those who choose to pay for this and seriously put themselve though a digital design course.

Rest assured, the courses will have huge discounts for those who supported me early on and students living through hardship. The HOLY CORE itself will ALWAYS be open source, but chances are it will take a lot of time to put toghether, in the meantime, well...

...Godspeed,

\- Hugo
